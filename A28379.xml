            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HEaring of ſome things in the Preface of your Book, relating to a noted-Perſon, who not long before had printed ſome paſſages, the noiſe of which (by the coming abroad of your Book, and as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you) filled the minds of many with admiration &amp; aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<note place="margin">One of which, and a groſs one, was from your, leaving out the word [no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>] menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Errata, with an Aſterisk pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to it.</note> I could not reſt till I had gotten a ſight of them. This occaſioned me at firſt to read your Preface, and afterwards your Treatiſe. And not being ſatisfied with your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb facs="tcp:42315:3"/>(having had ſome ſerious thoughts of that Point ſome Months before) I reſolved to attempt a friendly Anſwer. And if I be not much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (to the praiſe of God be it ſpoken) I found his preſence going along with me in that work. And becauſe you were willing to be ſatisfied, if as good proof were brought for Infants-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as for Womens receiving the Lords Supper, I thought good to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with that, and therefore could not follow you (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) in the ſame method, you uſe in your Book. I much wondered, when I ſaw in your Preface (and afterwards in your Book more at large) the Ancient <hi>Waldenſes</hi> produced as faithful impugners of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as a humane and Anti-Chriſtian Tradition and Invention] which in the ſpace of an hour or two, I found plainly, and expreſly in four or five places contradicted, out of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Albigenſes;</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>John Paul Perin,</hi> and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of French by <hi>Sampſon Leonard,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42315:3"/>Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1624. A particular account of which you will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſee; which gives juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that you may have failed, in ſome others of your humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, aſwell as in that. And a learned and judicious friend of mine (who hath examined your other Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations) aſſured me, that he finds the Teſtimonies much abuſed. He having the opportunity of a Library which I wanted, and having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken-pains therein, (unknown to me, even as mine was to him) I ſuppoſe you will have it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But as you well ſay, it is the Holy Scripture muſt be our Rule, and that alone can ſatisfie Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and to that I ſtick. He that knowes my Heart, knowes, that I deſire only, that the Truth may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and be received. Let the Truth ſtand, though we ſhould fall. I hope you will find no unbrotherly Language, or Bitterneſs, though ſometimes a little ſharpneſs, in what
<pb facs="tcp:42315:4"/>I have written. I have done my Preface to you, and commend the whole I have done, to him alone, who is able to accept it in Chriſt, and to make it accepted by your ſelf, and any others that ſhall reade it.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough many Judicious and Godly men have done worthily, in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Intereſt of the Infants of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents, in the External and Church-Diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace, made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, in their Generations; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, their Title to Baptiſm, which is now under the Goſpel, the Initiatory-Seal of that Covenant; So that it may be thought needleſs to write any more to clear that point: yet becauſe our Brethren of the adverſe party, do continue to ſet forth ſomething in oppoſition thereunto, and in
<pb facs="tcp:42315:5"/>particular, a Book lately ſet forth by <hi>H. D.</hi> much admired by ſome, and cryed-up as un-anſwerable, (unto which no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Anſwer that I know hath as yet been returned) I have taken ſome pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a brief and plain Anſwer to the moſt material things in it, which, I hope, will be underſtood by mean capacities. A thing (if I miſ-judg not) rather to be deſired, than found, in the writings of ſome able men, of profound learning and judgment: which renders their labours therein, not ſo uſeful, as otherwiſe they might be, to the weaker ſort, who are moſt eaſily drawn into the contrary perſwaſion. I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have been forced to uſe divers Greek words and Phraſes (eſpecially near the beginning) becauſe the force of my Argument lies in the Gender, and proper ſignification of them. But I hope, they are ſo plainly interpreted, that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reader, whoſe information and good I aim at, will not be at a loſs, as to the ſence of them. Many miſchiefs, Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Contradictions, are charged by <hi>H. D.</hi> upon Infant-Baptiſm, and thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:42315:5"/>that hold it; but with what Abſurdity they are ſo charged, will appear to thoſe that impartially read the enſuing <hi>Eſſay.</hi> Thoſe miſchiefs, and Abſurdities, will not at all follow from the nature of the thing it ſelf, as I have ſtated it; but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed fathered upon it by the ignorance or corruption of Men, who are prepoſſeſt and prejudiced againſt it, and pre-inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the contrary-perſwaſion. Sure we are, that the Contrary-Opinion, hath had many miſchiefs attending it; and many groſs-Abſurdities, do still attend it, naturally flowing out of the bowels of it. It lays a foundation of denying Women's partaking in the Lords Supper; and of the Chriſtian-Sabbath; and I wonder, that ſuch as deny Infant-Baptiſm (which hath as clear a foundation in the Holy Scripture) do not alſo deny the others. And whereas Infant-Baptiſm is alſo charged to be a bone of Contention, even among thoſe that hold it, whoſe grounds and opinions concerning it, are different; and therefore ſhould be utterly relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh't:] This is an Argument fitter to
<pb facs="tcp:42315:6"/>prevail with envaſſalled-Papiſts, than with thoſe, that love the Truth, and make Conſcience of Contending, for the leaſt grain of that Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. If this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument were valid, it might eaſily be ſhewn, That our oppoſite Brethren are not all of one mind, in all things pertaining to the caſe under debate. But it is not my deſign to ſtir the perſons of Men, but to make the Truth of God, and the riches of his Grace appear; that the God of Truth and Grace may have the glory; and the Reader may have ſome real benefit.</p>

               <p>IN Page 105. of your Book you ſay, we ſhall find, both Example and Command for Women's receiving the Lords Supper; and in Pag. 106. you ſay, Let but as good Proof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for Infants-Baptiſm, and it ſhall ſuffice. I ſhall now eſſay, by the Lord's help, to make as good Proof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if not better, that is, clearer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>
                     <hi>The Example you bring, is out of</hi> Act. 1.14. <hi>we read, ſay you, That</hi> Mary <hi>and other Women were gathered together, and that theſe Women with the reſt of the Diſciples, were all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in one Place, and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles-Doctrine and fellowſhip, and breaking of Bread, and Prayers,</hi> Acts 2.42, 44. <hi>It being expreſly ſaid, that all that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved were together.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42315:8"/>
               <p> You take this to be an evident Example, that Women received the Lords Supper; therefore that there is ground in Scripture to admit them, but that there is not the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of any Infants that have been Baptized. In Anſwer to which, I ſhall firſt premiſe four Things in general; and then Anſwer more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am not againſt inchurched-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's-receiving the Lords Supper, any more than againſt inchurched-Men; but do believe they have an equal right unto it, whil's they continue in a right eſtate in the Church. —But</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Example that you bring (and the Command alſo, as afterwards I ſhall ſhew) is not expreſs, nor ſo clear, as you make it to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is as much room for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it, as there is for Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Baptizing of Infants; (as I hope I ſhall make appear:) and that there is as much evidence and clearneſs for the latter, as you judge to be for the former.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the evidence that your Example and Command will afford you, for Womens receiving the Lords Supper; you muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, by way of conſequence, and that very darkly too, from what you bring, And if ſo, I hope you will uſe the ſame candour, integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42315:8"/>and right Reaſon, in allowing what will rationally follow from the Scriptures, that ſhall be produced for the Baptizing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Infants: <hi>Veniam dabimus, petimuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Viciſſim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now more particularly, to your Example.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not here expreſly-ſaid, that theſe Women were Believers, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14. but you muſt gather it by conſequence, from this, and other Scriptures compared together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Aſſembly was not the ſame, that is not mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42.44. For this was to conſtitute a new Apoſtle in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſomewhat before; as appears <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.1. The other is ſpoken of the multitude of Jews and Gentiles converted afterwards, when the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> was fully-come; and the Spirit given in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gift of Tongues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is no expreſs-mention, that thoſe Women were in, and of, that great Aſſembly, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, 44. who continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread and Prayers. How do you know, but that they might be dead, or ſick, or upon ſome other occaſion, abſent (as <hi>Thomas</hi> was before, <hi>John</hi> 20.24.) As here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing expreſt to the contrary; ſo nor any thing expreſly affirmed, that they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42315:9"/> 4. Nor is there any expreſs-mention of any other Women in that great Aſſembly, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.42, 44. though afterwards there is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.14. when the number was increaſed.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that <hi>Sapphyra</hi> is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mentioned, <hi>Acts.</hi> 5.1, 2. I Anſwer, neither doth that expreſly and directly prove your Aſſertion. For,

                     <item>2. If ſhe were, It is not ſaid, that ſhe received the Lords Supper; for ſhe might be dead before ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it.</item>
                     <item>3. You cannot ſay, ſhe was one of thoſe, that are ſpoken of <hi>Act</hi> 2.42, 44. for ſhe might be one of thoſe that were afterwards converted to the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. when the number was much increaſed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. to five thouſand Men.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The words upon which you lay the ſtreſs of Womens receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per here, are in expreſs-terms againſt you; though you take them expreſly for you: your words to prove, that thoſe Women did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord's Supper, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.14. with,

                  </gap>. And why not thoſe 2000, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. be ſo too?</p>
               <p>By theſe things you ſee, that this Inſtance and example; which you bring for womens receiving the Lord's Supper, is not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs as you make it to be, nor ſo void of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and yet you own their right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. I ſhall now produce as probable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Baptiſm of Children; and leave it to conſideration. Only, I ſhall firſt premiſe, that as there was no mention in expreſs-terms, of any woman that received the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as hath appeared); even ſo there is no mention in expreſs terms of any Infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Yet nevertheleſs, there is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude, both the one and the other, from the ſacred Scripture; and if you deny Inferences in the one, you muſt by the ſame reaſondeny them in the other.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42315:10"/>
               <p> In particular, 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Lydia</hi> wa Baptized and her Houſe, (or Houſhold) <gap reason="foreign">

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Houſe (or houſhold) of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16. And it is apparent in Scripture, that Houſe] doth comprehend Children, in its ſignification, in ſundry places; and it is often put to ſignifie Children and Poſterity chiefly, if not only, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not cut off thy kindneſs from my Houſe</hi>] ſaith <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> minded it afterwards, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.1. <hi>Is there yet any left of the Houſe of</hi> Saul, <hi>that I may ſhew him kindneſs for</hi> Jonathan's <hi>ſake?</hi> yea, <hi>Jonathan hath yet a</hi> Mephiboſheth, <hi>a Son, which is lame on his feet</hi> v. 3.

               <p>Now to ſum up the whole; we find in the Scripture (which next the Holy Spirit, is the beſt Expoſitor of it ſelf) that the word <hi>Houſe</hi>] is often put for Children, yea, for young Children; and that <hi>Lydia</hi> and her Houſe, and <hi>Stephanas</hi> his Houſe, was Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Let impartial perſons judge whether this doth not carry as much, if not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability and evidence in it, than what hath been brought for Women's receiving the Lord's Supper; and not liable to ſuch excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the context, nor from any other Scripture.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to examine that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that is brought, to warrant Women to receive the Lord's Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Let a Man,</hi> or Woman ſay you, <hi>Examine</hi> and <hi>ſo eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The Woman can be but implied in this word if it had been left unlimited; for, If it had been expreſly ſpoken of the Woman the Article <hi>He</hi>) ſhould have been expreſt:

I muſt confeſs, it is not pleaſing to me to raiſe Objections againſt any Truth of God, nor yet would I loſe any grain of Truth, that will flow from a Scripture, nor would I have done this, but to ſhew, that there is as much, if not more ſhew, of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,

               </p>
               <p>This Text of <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Chriſts Commiſſion, being thus expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cleared; gives us light to expound the ſame commiſſion laid down in other words, by the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark,</hi> Chapt. 16.15, 16.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Go ye forth into all the World</hi> (not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan</hi> only) <hi>and Preach the Goſpel to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature:</hi> that is, not only to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but to the Gentiles alſo, that they may be converted and believe. And for this end, Chriſt promiſed them his Spirit to he preſent with them, in the work of their Miniſtry, <hi>to Convince the World,</hi> (that is the Elect of God among the Gentiles, aſwel as the <hi>Jews) of Sin, Righteouſneſs, and Judgment, Joh.</hi> 16.8. This is the firſt thing implied in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42315:17"/>the word <hi>Diſcipling, Matth.</hi> 28.19. but is not all, that is implied in it, (as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed); for the word <hi>Diſciple,</hi> hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in it, and is of a larger ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the word <hi>Believer.</hi> By this their preaching, Adult, and grown perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to God's Election, ſhould be brought to believe in Chriſt; which hath more in it, than meerly to be taught the Doctrine of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being made Believers, it was their duty now, to look after Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that they might regularly attain it; it was their duty to enter into a Goſpel-Church-Eſtate; to be firſt <hi>Diſcipled,</hi> and then to be <hi>Baptized.</hi> Thus theſe two Scriptures do help to expound each other. <hi>Preaching the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> to bring them to believe] ſhew's, that there is more in the Word, <hi>Diſcipling</hi>] than conſtituting a viſible Church. And the word <hi>Diſcipling</hi>] ſhew's that a viſible-Church-Eſtate, ſhould ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and orderly come between the believing of ſuch Converted-Perſons, and their being Baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be objected, that <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Goſpel-Church-Eſtate to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Believing, and being Baptized; but of Believing only.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42315:17"/> 1. Neither doth <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeak any thing here, of teaching them to obſerve all things, that Chriſt hath commanded, as <hi>Matthew</hi> doth; yet, we may not thence infer, that they ſhould not be taught to obſerve them, becauſe he ſaith nothing of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor doth <hi>Matthew</hi> ſay as <hi>Mark</hi> doth, <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized ſhall he Saved he that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> which yet we may not deny to be true, becauſe <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> ſaith nothing of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſufficient, that the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew</hi> doth ſpeak of <hi>Diſcipling,</hi> before Baptizing. We ſhould take it as a ſingular mercy of God, that hath ſo expreſt himſelf in Scripture, that we (by the gracious help of his Spirit) comparing Scripture with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may come to ſee his mind therein; and may find that in one Scripture, which is not mentioned in another.</p>

               <p>Therefore, ſome of thoſe, on whom they laid that Yoke, muſt be Children of Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Parents: to wit, Children of eight days old.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Immediate: that do actually, in their own perſons (having firſt approved themſelves to the Church) receive and lay hold of the Covenant of Grace (held forth to them in a Church-way) for themſelves, and their Seed; and giving up themſelves and their Seed, to the Lord, and to his Church,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7.</note> by the will of God. This they do for their Seed, as middle-perſons by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and not as publick perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mediate; by means of their Parent or Parents (one or both). And hence ariſeth the Diſtinction of Immediate and mediate Church-Members; diſtinct from each other in kind, which may thus be proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> Such as is the confederation of little Children, ſuch is their Church-Memberſhip;</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:42315:19"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Aſſump.</hi> But their confederation is Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> Therefore their Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is mediate alſo.</p>
                  <p>This is the Argument of that reverend, and accompliſhed ſervant of God, Mr. <hi>John Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is evident; becauſe Church-Confederation is the proper, and formal-cauſe and reaſon of Church-Memberſhip. <hi>Et cui forma tribuitur vol adimitur, eidem &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is alſo clear (for it is plain that all ſuch Childrens confederation, is in, and by] their Parent, or Parent's confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for them; <hi>(Mediante Parente).</hi> And this makes their Memberſhip Mediat. Were this diſtinction generally held, by them that hold <hi>Paedobaptiſm,</hi> our diſſenting Brethren, that are againſt Infant-Memberſhip, and Infant-Baptiſm, would be freed from a great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For they ſee, that if Children be Church-Members of the ſame kind and <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> equally with their Parents: then, when they are grown up, they may by virtue of that Member-ſhip,
<note place="margin">Relata enim non ſuſcipiunt magis &amp; minus.</note> challenge a right to all other Church-Ordinances, becauſe they are Church-Members, as their Parents were,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42315:20"/>and ſtand in a right Eſtate in the Church, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never been caſt out. I muſt confeſs, that by ſuch a ſucceſſion of Members, as this is, the Church would be ſadly corrupted. But if this Diſtinction of Immediate, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Members were held; then might our Brethren eaſily ſee, that the Memberſhip of Children, which is mediate, would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to full Communion with the Church in all Ordinances proper to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult; but they muſt become Immediate-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by their own credible profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, to the ſatisfaction of the Church, and laying hold of the Covenant ſolemnly themſelves, as their Parents have done before them. And this would be a way according to God, to maintain a ſucceſſion of Infant-Members (to whom there are divers Priviledges belonging, tending to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion) and yet to keep the Church pure. See Mr. <hi>Baxter's</hi> Book of Confirmation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath ſolidly proved the ſubſtance of what I here aſſert.</p>
                  <p>And now it will be requiſite, to recollect what hath been more largely diſcourſed, and to apply it to the ſcope intended. I have ſhewed, that there are as many, and as probable objections, againſt both the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and command, that have been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>H. D.</hi> for Womens receiving the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42315:20"/>Lord's Supper; as are againſt the Baptiſm of Children of Inchurched-Parents. And that there are if not clearer, yet as clear Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of Scripture for the latter, as for the former, and therefore as little reaſon to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the latter as againſt the former. My intent is not to quarrel, but rather to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this difference, if the Lord ſee it good.</p>

               <p>AS to to the Baptiſm of Believers, I know none that are for Infant-Baptiſm do oppoſe it; provided—1. That they be Believers in a Goſpel-Church-Eſtate— 2. That they be ſuch Believers, as have not before been Baptized in their minority.</p>
               <p>But the former part of your book tending to prove, that only Actual Believers ſhould be Baptized; I cannot perceive, that your proofs do confirm it, either from Scripture, or humane Teſtimonies. The generality of them, if I apprehend them rightly, ſpeak only of Adult perſons, and therein we agree with you; that Adult perſons ought to teſtifie their Faith and Repentance to the judgment of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Charity of the Church, guided in judging, by the Rules of God's Word, before they are admitted to be Members; and to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42315:21"/>Baptiſm. And I believe, you cannot but judge, that the Teſtimonies you bring from Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and ſome others, were ſo intended, and not at all againſt Infants. I ſhall leave that, to them that are concerned and are yet alive, to explain and vindicate their own ſence.</p>
               <p>But as for ſome others, who (as you ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them) ſpeak more punctually to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; which I have neither time, nor Books to examine; I look upon the caſe of Infant-Baptiſm, as little concerned in them; the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture alone, as you confeſs, being the only Rule that can ſatisfie Conſcience. Yet were it not too tedious a task, I could ſhew you many miſtakes in your apprehenſions of divers of them. And you may ſee Anſwers to ſundry of them, in Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> and ſome others, which yet you take no notice of.</p>
               <p>I grant that all Adult Perſons to be admitted to the Church and to Baptiſm, ought to Anſwer that Rule and Order, which you mention in Chap. 1. of your firſt part. But there is another Rule and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the Infants of Inchurched-Parents, which will alſo come under Chriſt's Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as hath been already proved. Such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being Diſciples and mediate members of the viſible Church, and ſo, to be Baptized; as well as their Parents are Diſciples, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42315:21"/>Immediate Members, and ſo to be Baptized, if they were not Baptized before; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need no other Commiſſion, nor Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, than what Chriſt hath in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, already given, which I deſire may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IN general; that divers of thoſe you mention, are peculiar to grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which I ſhall grant; but do not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent concern Infants and Children in minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Some others of them I wholly except againſt, as ſhall appear in the particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To your firſt End, <hi>That the Baptized might have that repreſented</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>in a ſigne or figure,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☞ According to this; no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ſhould ever be Baptized, any more than an Infant; which I have often occaſion to mind you of.</note> 
                     <hi>and preacht to his Eye—which had been preacht to his Ear, and heart, by the Word &amp; Spirit of God — a ſign of the whole Miſtery of the Goſpel; which Infants, wanting underſtanding and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42315:22"/>judgment, are no more capable of, than a Stock or a Stone.</hi>
                  </q> This is the ſum of what you ſay.</p>
               <p>To which I reply, That it is indeed requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that grown-perſons to be Baptized ſhould firſt be inſtructed in the Myſteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; as the Eunuch was, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.34, 35.— But it is not ſo with Infants; but they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to be inſtructed in them, and to be taught, when they grow up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. and be inſtructed in the meaning and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Sacraments; as of old they were; and Children ſhould when grown, ask, as they were to do, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26. <hi>What mean you by this ſervice?</hi> See <hi>v.</hi> 27. and <hi>Exod</hi> 13.8. and ſhould improve it as an Argument, to ſtir them up, to cry to God for Regenerating-Grace. Beſides, it is of Uſe to the Parents, and to the Church alſo, (as ſhall be ſhewed) who have the uſe of Reaſon. The want of the uſe of Reaſon in an Infant, is no eſſential defect, as to the External ſuſception of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. The Child is meerly-Paſſive, in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; and ſo is the Soul in Regeneration, which is in a ſpecial manner, ſignified in that Ordinance. And we ſhould adore the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, that hath ſo ſuited the ſign to the thing ſignified, which the Child ſhould afterwards labour for.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:42315:22"/> 2. To your ſecond, <hi>that the party Baptized might thereby</hi> witneſs <hi>his Repentance</hi>] I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it a miſtake. For thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11.3.6. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. do declare, that thoſe Adult perſons, were firſt to witneſs their Repentance (which is ſet forth, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their ſins), and then to be Baptized. Elſe <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> muſt have acted blindfold; and might have Baptized the Phariſees among the reſt; which he did not, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not teſtifie their Repentance, though they came to his Baptiſm, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.31, 32.</p>
               <p>And as for them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. It's expreſly ſaid, <hi>Repent and be Baptized.</hi> Repentance muſt be manifeſted by them, yea, and alſo enter into the Goſpel-Church (which they did by gladly receiving the Word, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Covenant held forth afreſh unto them, <hi>v.</hi> 39.) before they were Baptized, <hi>v.</hi> 41. So that Baptiſm was not to witneſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the Adult perſon to be Baptized, but he was to witneſs it before, that he might be Baptized.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the 3. I Anſwer; That the End of Baptiſm, is not to evidence preſent Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If you mean it of Adult-perſons, that was to be evidenced before, to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Rational-Charity of the Church. And in reference to Infants, it is not requiſite,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42315:23"/>that Regeneration ſhould precede, or be at that preſent, when they are Baptized. Yet who can ſay peremptorily, of this, or that Infant, that it is not regenerated? Doubtleſs, God doth Regenerate Elect-Infants, that die in Infancy, though in a way and time unknown to us.—But more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſuppoſe you will not hold, that all that you Baptize, are certainly at preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated. Sad experience ſhew's you the contrary. The moſt you can ſay, is; that to the beſt of your judgment, they are. And how then can your Poſition and Practice ſtand together?</p>
               <p n="2">2. There ought to be, and regularly is, in an orderly Goſpel-Church, viſible-preſent-Regeneration, in one of the Parents at leaſt, to the Rational judgment of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which ſuch a parent is a Member, and in a right eſtate. And this is enough to entitle the Child to Baptiſm; by virtue of that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting-Covenant under an Eccleſiaſtical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed. Thou ſhalt keep my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant therefore, v.</hi> 9. that is, <hi>Circumciſe every Male, v.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God's Covenant to in-churched-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in reference to their Seed, is, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>The Lord thy God will Circumciſe the heart of thy Seed.</hi> And
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42315:23"/>for that end, to give them means of Grace. And this Promiſe, ſuch Parents ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for their Children, and ſo ſhould the Children themſelves, when they come to years of diſcretion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Baptiſm now, as Circumciſion of old, is a ſeal of God's Covenant, as Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically diſpenſed; that is, in a viſible-Church way, and accordingly, ſo cloſed with, and accepted. It is not Immediately the Seal of Regeneration; but indefinitely of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, Externally and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally-diſpenſed, and received; within which inchurched-Parents-Children are. <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy Seed;</hi> therefore <hi>Circumciſe all thy Males, Gen.</hi> 17.7.10, 11. from all which it follow's, that Baptiſm is not immediately to evidence preſent Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but to be a Seal of God's Covenant, in which future Regeneration is conditionally implied, as no inconſiderable thing held forth by it. Your ſelf have granted, that both Circumciſion and Baptiſm do ſignify heart-Circumciſion,</p>
               <p n="5">5. According to your Aſſertion, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſhould have been Circumciſed; for your ſelf do afterwards grant (which I heartily congratulate) that there is a parity between Baptiſm and Circumciſion, both of them ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the ſame end. If ſo, then Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42315:24"/>ſignified and ſealed ſpiritual things in the Covenant, to Infants-circumciſed. Not that they were at preſent Regenerated; but God was before-hand with them, leaving them a conditional-Promiſe under Seal, to Regenerate and Circumciſe their hearts; which was no ſmall encouragement to them, when grown, and to their Parents at preſent to pray for Regenerating-Grace for them. Yet according to what you hold, this they ſhould have been deprived of; becauſe Circumciſion as well as Baptiſm, ſhould be a ſign and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of preſent Regeneration, and not of future, by your Aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Parent entring into a Church-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, engages himſelf and his Seed to God, to walk according to his Covenant of Grace, to which the initiatory Seal of the Covenant is annexed. And God hath engaged himſelf in that Covenant <hi>to be his God and the God of his Seed, Deut.</hi> 17.7. And both the Parent and his Seed alſo when come to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſhould improve this Covenant and the Seal of it, not only for forgiveneſs of ſins by Chriſt's Blood, but more immediately that God would be a God unto them, to give and continue means of Grace and Converſion, and give his Spirit along with thoſe means, to convert, and bring them to Chriſt; and then by his Blood to waſh them from their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42315:24"/>ſins, and make them Heirs of Eternal Life. And thus, when one Baptized in Infancy, is afterwards truly Converted, he hath then the ſpiritual good, and virtue of his Baptiſm, and may, by the help of the Spirit of Grace, look back upon his Baptiſm with comfort, and have that Anſwer (or rather demand and Interogation) of a good Conſcience,

               <p n="4">4. To the ſixth End you mention; which is <hi>to repreſent the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion betwixt Chriſt and a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, &amp;c. p.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>I would firſt ask you, whether all ſuch grown-perſons, as you Baptize, be true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt? and ſo, have indeed, a ſpiritual, and ſaving-Union with Chriſt? (for that's your ſcope, and to that purpoſe ſpeaks your teſtimony out of Dr. <hi>Taylor).</hi> But this is ſo contrary to Truth, and to your own
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42315:25"/>experience, that I think, you will not dare to maintain it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I anſwer; Chriſt may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, Perſonally or myſtically, again, either Spiritually, or Eccleſiaſtically; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. So is Chriſt. Now, Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, is ſuitable to this diſtinction. All true Believers in Chriſt, are Spiritually united to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and ſhall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſaved by him. Others that make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of true faith in Chriſt, but have not indeed a true faith, may be united to Chriſt, as Eccleſiaſtically-conſidered; that is, they may be viſible Members of Chriſt's viſible Church. See <hi>John</hi> 15.1.2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt is the Vine, and Believers both Real and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the Branches in a different reſpect. True Believers are Living-Branches, and bring forth fruit in Chriſt, unto Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; falſe and feigned Believers, are dead Branches that are for the fire, even for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire. If then, theſe dead Branches be in Chriſt Eccleſiaſtically, to wit, Members of him as head of the Church viſible; why then ſhould the Infants of Inchurched-Parents be excluded from ſuch an External Union with Chriſt, becauſe they do not at preſent truely Believe, but are dead branches at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Though it is more than you, or any man can peremptorily ſay, that this, or that,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42315:25"/>Infant, hath no work of Grace begun in him, nor is ſpiritually-united to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppoſe an Infant hath a ſecret work of Grace begun in him (which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly God doth work in Elect-dying Infants); then according to your Doctrine, ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſhould be Baptized, becauſe he hath Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; and yet he can make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith; and ſo, you cannot know it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To your ſeventh End I anſwer; that the End of Baptiſm I conceive is not, that the Baptized Perſon, may orderly thereby, have an entrance into the viſible Church. Nor was Circumciſion of old, the viſible door of Entrance into the Old-Teſtament-Church. For, Baptiſm preſuppoſeth the perſon to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the viſible Church, and ſo did Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. And though ſome of thoſe that are for Infant-Baptiſm, uſe ſuch expreſſions; yet I ſuppoſe by their diſcourſe in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they mean, that it was only a ſolemn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment and ſealing of that Covenant in which they were before.

And hence, the careleſs omiſſion, and neglect thereof, was a breaking of God's Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 14. By what hath been ſaid, appear's, that the End of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was not to give entrance into the old Teſtament-Church, for they were entred by the Covenant; and that the End of Baptiſm, which anſwers to Circumciſion, is not to give entrance into the New-Teſtament-Church, for they were entred before, by their intereſt in the Covenant, of which Baptiſm is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and a Seal.</p>
               <p>To put an end to this Chapter, we hold
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42315:26"/>with you, that none ought to be admitted to the Lord's Supper, that have not been before baptized; from the Analogy between theſe, and the two Sacraments of old. <hi>No uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof, Exod.</hi> 12.48. And hence I cannot ſee, how ſome that are againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and hold it a Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, can admit them to the Lord's Supper, who in their judgments, have never been Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. And here I cannot but take notice of your partiality; you make uſe of Analogy in this caſe, but will not allow of it, in the caſe of Baptizing of Infants from Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Circumciſed of old.</p>

               <p n="1">1. TO the Infants themſelves, when grown up. God's Covenant and Baptiſm the ſeal of it, will be of uſe to the Child afterwards, to encourage him to ſeek the Lord for converting Grace. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed]</hi> hath no ſmall argument in it. <hi>David</hi> knew it, when he ſaid, <hi>Thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Father,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. — <hi>My

               <p n="2">2. To the Parents; Baptiſm now (as Circumciſion of old) is a comfort, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Parents, to ſtir them up, and encourage their Faith to pray and wreſtle with God, for the Converſion of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and to train them up in the way, that they ſhould go. I bleſs God I have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this to be a Truth, and ſtill do; and would not leave this Priviledge in the behalf of my Children, for all the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the Church alſo. They have a preſent Uſe of the Baptiſm of Inchurched-Children; for thereby, they may reflect upon the rich Grace and Goodneſs of God, to them and their Seed, and be put in mind of their Duty to their Children, to bring them up <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Hereby alſo they are minded of their duty of watchfulneſs over the Parents of ſuch Children, to ſee, that they train them up in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42315:27"/>the ways of the Lord: (A duty too much neglected). And alſo to mind them of their engagement to ſuch Children, in caſe their Parents ſhould die, or be impoveriſhed; they having been ſolemnly conſecrated to God in the preſence of the Church, and owned by them. Laſtly, That it is the duty of the Church, as well as of the Miniſters of it, to pray for converting Grace for ſuch Children; whom they have ſeen ſolemnly conſecrated to God,

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>In your fifth Chapter,</hi> p. 35. <hi>you would prove Believers-Baptiſm to be the only Baptiſm, from the New-Teſtament-Diſpenſation, ſo differing from that of the Old. Teſtament-Church, which you ſay, was national, conſiſting of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and fleſhly Seed of Abraham.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO which I Reply; If by Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Church in this place you mean the Church, as it was firſt conſtituted in Abraham's Family, Gen. 17. I muſt deny it to be National; for it became not National, till the Lord brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſet up a National-worſhip amongſt them at <hi>Mount-Sinai.</hi> And this is expreſly called, the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42315:28"/>Old-Covenant, in reference to the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant under the Goſpel, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9. <hi>I will make a New-Covenant—not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers, in the day, that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> And to this that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath relation, Chapter 16.8. <hi>I entred into a Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> Therefore, the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God put him and his Family into a Church-Eſtate, is not that National-Covenant which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls the Old-Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9. and now gives way to the New; but is that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which, for the ſubſtance of it, ſtill remains, and is come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. But by the Old Covenant, which is now out of doors is meant (as the Lord himſelf explains it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9.) That National-Covenant, that he made with their Fathers when he led them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> unto <hi>Sinai:</hi> the Moral Law being then given with Terrour; and the Ceremonial Law annext unto it, (as their Schoolmaſter to lead them to Chriſt then to come; who by his death ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it, and put an end to it, nailing it to his Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14.) And this is called the Old Covenant in reference to the New one, made now in the Goſpel-days; which is the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42315:28"/>revived, and freed from thoſe loads of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, wherewith it was once burdened. Now it is not new in reſpect of the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and eſſence of the Covenant (for they are both the Covenant of Grace: ſee <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.5. <hi>Gods Spirit was among them then;</hi> ſee alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3.11.) but in reſpect of the new manner of Diſpenſation of it, the Articles of Grace being now more expreſs; promiſes inſtead of precepts; and the Seals of it more clear, eaſy ſignificant and ſuitable to a Covenant of Grace. As the Commandment of Love is called an Old Commandment, and a New-Commandment, in a different reſpect only, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.7, 8. ſo may one and the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, be called old and new, in a different reſpect. Hence follows;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Nationality of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did not conſiſt in this, that they were the natural and fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but by virtue of the Covenant, diſpenſed in a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, after they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For God's promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> (to wit; <hi>I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my Covenant between me and thee, and thy Seed after thee, in their Generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God to thee and thy Seed after thee</hi>) was long before that Church became National.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That worldly Sanctuary, Carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, a Temporary Levitical Prieſt-hood
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42315:29"/>and multitude of Ceremonies, did not belong unto the Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, but were peculiar to the Church as National: which began near about 400 years after, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>viz.</hi> when God brought them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If by ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham, p.</hi> 36. you mean thoſe, that did truly and ſavingly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; as you ſeem to take it (for you do not at all diſtinguiſh, between Spiritual and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical) then it is apparently untrue. For, in the New-Teſtament-Church, there was an <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphyra,</hi> and a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who yet were regularly admitted to the Church, though they were not true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And here I muſt again return you to your own experience and practice.</p>
               <p>Therefore, upon that change, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not diſcharge that Priviledge of the Church-Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> as you ſay he did; I mean of the Infants of Inchurched-Parents, from any ſuch right in the New-Teſtament, as you affirm. But he ſpeaks to the grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons, that reſted in that Priviledge, and boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of their being the natural Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> though they continued impenitent, unregenerate, ſlighting and rejecting Chriſt, on whom <hi>John</hi> directed them to believe. compare <hi>Math.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 11. with <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19.) not at all perſorming their Covenant-duty. In
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42315:29"/>like manner we may now ſafely ſay to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Inchurched-Parents, (that are grown up, and pleaſe themſelves, that they were the Children of ſuch Parents, and harden themſelves in impenitency and unbelief) as <hi>John</hi> did then; Think not to ſay, we are the Children of Godly-Inchurched-Parents. This will neither free you from unquenchable fire, nor bring you to Heaven, nor admit you as Adult-Members, into a Goſpel-Church, and into full Communion with the Saints therein, in all Church-Ordinances; but you muſt bring forth fruits meet for Repentance (at leaſt to the judgment of Rational-Charity) or elſe you cannot be admitted thereunto. This therefore, doth not exclude the Infant-ſeed of a Parent admitted into a Goſpel-Church, and continuing in a right Eſtate therein.</p>
               <p>If the Church-Priviledges of the natural Seed of Inchurched-Parents be now ceaſed, in theſe Goſpel-days; what then mean's that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. ſpoken of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be called in theſe latter days? That they are beloved for the Fathers ſakes. It would be ſad and lamentable, if believing-Parents, now under the Goſpel, ſhould have no ſuch Priviledge left them, in reference to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſtates of their poor Children. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Church-Members had a promiſe, that <hi>God would be the God of their Seed, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42315:30"/>the hearts of their Seed to love the Lord, with all the Heart, and all the Soul, Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. but now, by the coming of Chriſt, it is ceaſed. This is ſad indeed. What viſible grounds of hope, of any ſaving Grace or Mercy, have Inchurched-Chriſtians now, in reference to their Children, more than Turks and Pagans have? <hi>Durus Sermo!</hi> yet, ſome have been ſo bold, as in plain terms to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p>But are they ceaſed indeed? when and where hath God repealed them? Not by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, as we have made appear. Nor could I yet ever ſee, that he hath done it by any other hand. Hence therefore they muſt be in force ſtill. Hath God given his people promiſes of food and raiment, and other tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things, for their encouragement and comfort, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and left them no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe at all, now in Goſpel times, to help their faith, concerning their poor Childrens eternal Eſtate, whoſe ſouls they prize more than their own lives? The Apoſtle ſaw ſomething in it, when he ſaid, we that are Jews by nature, and not ſinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. And why not alſo in a ſafe ſence, Chriſtians by nature, and not ſinners of the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans,</hi> who are yet ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. as the Gentiles generally then were.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:42315:30"/>
               <p> You will ſay, we are all by nature, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. And was not <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe Jews ſo too? and yet the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes that diſtinction between them. And whence was it, but from God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, in which they externally were, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Coverſion? And why there ſhould not be the like Priviledge of Children of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents, I never yet could ſee. And hence ſuch a child may go to God and plead; <hi>Lord, thou art my Fathers God, Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>and haſt promiſed to be my God.</hi> And a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent may go and plead; <hi>Lord, thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be my God, and the God of my Seed, and to circumciſe their hearts to Love thee, Deut.</hi> 30.6. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. O! let it be ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy promiſe. Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thine offspring, Iſa.</hi> 44.3. and then one ſhould ſay, <hi>I am the Lord's, &amp;c.</hi> ſee <hi>v.</hi> 5. they ſhould engage themſelves to the Lord, and to his Church, by the ſtrongeſt bonds. And this is a Goſpel-promiſe, and belonging to Goſpel-times; and a great part of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. Why then ſhould any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it? Is not the ſecond Commandment ſtill in force, to parents in Church-Covenant with God in reference to their Children, whom they have given over to God in his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42315:31"/>Covenant? Hath he not there ſaid, He will <hi>have mercy on thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandements?</hi> That is, on ſuch Parents as give up themſelves to God, in the Commands of his Inſtituted Worſhip, in reference to their Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.1, 2. even to a thouſand Generations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. But repayeth them that hate him; (to wit, in a ſinful neglecting, or rejecting his inſtituted Worſhip) to their face, <hi>v.</hi> 10. And this is one way, whereby God doth teſtifie it, even by rejecting their Children, ſo, as not to vouchſafe them the External Priviledge of his Covenant, and means of Grace. See an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtance of it in <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterity, who ſold his birth-right,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6.</note> which was then a Church-Priviledge; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called a profane perſon, and ſo loſt the bleſſing, from himſelf, and his: ſee the like in <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and his Generations.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did not, upon that change, diſcharge the Church-Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> which I ſhall yet a little further explain; by opening the Children of the Fleſh, and the Children of the Promiſe, which are accounted for the ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>—1. Negatively.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42315:31"/> 1. By Children of the fleſh, cannot be meant, the natural Children of believers, as their natural Children.—Nor</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their Children, that have only ſin and corruption in them; for then, <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt have been a Child of the fleſh. For he was the natural Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſinful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By Children of the promiſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant, only ſuch as are really-converted. For many that were of <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Poſterity and ſo Children of the Promiſe, were not ſo, and ſome in Goſpel-Churches are not ſo now.</p>
               <p>—2. Affirmatively. Firſt by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Fleſh] are meant,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of old <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, begotten by ſtrength of nature; which was the Type.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now in Goſpel-times; all ſuch as look for righteouſneſs and life, by their own perſonal performances or abilities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in whole or in part: and that not only inviſibly, but viſibly and Eccleſiaſtically alſo; as the Apoſtle ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that now is (the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of the other) in bondage with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe] are meant;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42315:32"/> 1. Of old; <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his Poſterity, in the line of <hi>Jacob;</hi> which was the Type.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now in Goſpel-times; all ſuch as look for righteouſneſs and life, alone by faith in Chriſt, his righteouſneſs only, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of Grace. And theſe again are either;</p>
               <p n="1">1. All ſuch as are true believers indeed; who look by a true and lively-Faith, to Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or ſuch as profeſs only, and pretend to do ſo, but indeed do not. Theſe latter ſeem, and appear to be Believers, to Men, to the viſible-Church; but are not really-ſuch, before God. Yet, even theſe are Children of the Promiſe, in the genuine ſence of the Scripture, and not Children of the Fleſh, in the Apoſtles ſence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21, 22, 23, &amp;c. God doth, and will indeed, diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpiritual ſeed, and thoſe that are meerly the Church-ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> but Men cannot, unleſs by ſome miſcarriages they diſcover themſelves, and appear to be what they are; as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.23.</p>
               <p>And thus under one, we have an expoſition of that,
<note place="margin">Eâdem fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liâ duos parie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</note> Gal. 3.7. They which are of Faith, the ſame are the Children of <hi>Abraham.</hi>] they which are of Faith; [to wit, true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42315:32"/>indeed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was] are Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſavingly the Children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And they, which are of Faith, to wit, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in appearance only, before the Church only; they are only Eccleſiaſtically the Children of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And this is ſufficient to entitle them to Church-Ordinances, and their Children to Baptiſm, the initiatory Seal of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>And this alſo helps us to expound, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Seed, &amp;c.</hi> Men may be ſaid to be Chriſt's, and alſo to be <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed—1. Spiritually and Inviſibly.—2. Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically and viſibly only.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Spiritually and Inviſibly, as to Men; <hi>In foro Dei;</hi> before God alone, who is the <hi>only knower and ſearcher of the heart, and Tryer of the Reins.</hi> And ſo, none are <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſeed but ſuch as do truly and ſavingly-believe as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. This is the Faith of God's Elect, and peculiar to ſuch as ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Eccleſiaſtically and viſibly: <hi>In foro Eccleſiae;</hi> before Men only; to the viſible-Church. And in this ſence, all ſuch as make a rational and credible profeſſion of Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the judgment of Rational-Charity, in a Church-way; they are <hi>Chriſt's</hi> and <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed. And then it amounts
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42315:33"/>to this; to wit, If ye be <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſpiritually; then are ye <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed ſpiritually, and ſhall be Eternally-bleſſed, with faithful <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if ye be <hi>Christs</hi> Eccleſiaſtically-only, and in the judgment of Men, of the Church-only; then are ye alſo <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtically only, and in the judgment of Men only; and may expect only an External and Temporal bleſſing, and ſo we have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition alſo of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. And that this is the Apoſtles ſence, is plain in this chapter, and in other places of this Epiſtle. <hi>Ye are all</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Children of God, by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, Gal.</hi> 3.26. Were they indeed all of them True Believers? and ſo, all of them Children of God ſpiritually and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Doth not the Apoſtle tell them, He was afraid of them (ſome of them at leaſt, that would be under the Law) leſt he had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them labour in vain? And that he travelled with them in Birth again, till <hi>Christ</hi> was formed in them? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.11.19. They made a better ſhew once, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1.3, 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.15. but now he was in doubt of them; &amp; yet theſe he calls, <hi>the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> They were yet ſo Externally, being yet a Church of God, though at preſent troubled and ſeduced by falſe Teachers, from whoſe errors he hoped
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42315:33"/>and laboured to recover them.</p>
               <p>Take another Text like unto this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.7. <hi>As many of you as have been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they had put on Chriſt Spiritually and ſavingly, they would never have put him off again. And had they been once in Jeſus Chriſt Spiritually and ſavingly, they would never have gone out of him again. It's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt therefore, that ſome of them put him on, and were in him, Externally only, and in outward profeſſion only, before Men. For ſuch branches there are found in Chriſt the true Vine, conſidered as head of the viſible Church, <hi>John</hi> 15.2.6. And our Brethren muſt experimentally acknowledge, that it is ſo in their Congregations too often.</p>
               <p>What you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 37. That nothing ſhort of the Spirits-Birth, can orderly-admit to Water-Birth (<hi>i. e.</hi> Baptiſm, I ſuppoſe, you mean) and Spiritual Ordinances;] is fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to before, as to the ſubſtance of it. Perſons making a credible profeſſion of the Spirits birth, to the judgment of Rational-Charity, guided in judging by the Rules of of the Word, may orderly be admitted to Water-Birth (as you phraſe it) and ſpiritual-Ordinances; as appears by <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and others, who yet had but a ſhew of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits-Birth,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42315:34"/>&amp; not the truth, and reality of it. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.8. with <hi>v.</hi> 22.23. The reaſon is, becauſe Men, who cannot ſee directly, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and infallibly into the heart, are to judge of them. The ſame anſwer will ſerve to that of Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and to that which is cited out of Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> And as to that of Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> it is ſuitable to his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſign, <hi>&amp; gratis dictum,</hi> and there may reſt, till he give us ſome Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>

               <p>YOur aſſertion and proofs in your ſixth Chapter have reſpect only to immediate and grown-Members, who alone we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are capable of the Directions and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges you mention.</p>
               <p>Children of ſuch are but Mediate-Members (as hath been ſhewn) and are ſuch, as to whom thoſe things do not belong. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle therefore mentions the duties &amp; priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Immediate &amp; Adult-Members only.</p>
               <p>I do not hold, that a Goſpel-Church is conſtituted of Infants, but of grown-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, profeſſing viſible Saints; and to ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks; yet, the Infants of ſuch, are alſo Members, though of another kind.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42315:34"/>The Church may be a Church, though there be at preſent never an Infant in it; but I queſtion whether it be ſo, if there be no men, grown-perſons in it.</p>
               <p>I would ask, whether Women were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all thoſe directions given by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to thoſe Churches? you may as well ſay, they were not Members of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not ſubjects capacitated for thoſe directions: Women were not capable of Church-judging and ſome other Church-Acts; therefore are not members of the Church; I ſuppoſe you will not like ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing. If Infants are not Members becauſe they are not capable of the Apoſtles directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Churches; then Women muſt not be Members becauſe they alſo are uncapable of them.</p>
               <p>If it were granted to be true, that thoſe firſt inventers of Infant-Baptiſm (as you ſtile them) did ſo miſerably miſs it in the Subjects; applying the Spiritual Ordinance to ignorant Babes, yet, Childiſhly ridiculous] is too ſlight an expreſſion, for ſo miſerable a miſtake. But you have not yet proved, that there were ſuch Inventers of Infant-Baptiſm. The Scripture gives us ground to conclude that it was on foot long before thoſe Inventers you intimate, and that God in Chriſt was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of it. The ground of which, we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42315:35"/>have ſhewed in Chriſt's Commiſſion alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>As for ſome, that hold <hi>Paedo-Baptiſm,</hi> let them maintain their own Principles and Practices, if they can. I think ſome can never juſtify them by Goſpel-Rules; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it hath been an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to many,

Yea, I ſhall add, nor any, but ſuch, one of whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at leaſt, is of a Goſpel-Church, and ſo the Child a Mediate-Member thereof, who afterwards muſt not be admitted as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate-Member, and partake of all Church-Ordinances, without his own credible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith and Repentance, and entring into Covenant in his own Perſon.

                     <hi>True it is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that being conſtrained for ſome certain hundred years</hi> (he tell's us not how many) <hi>to ſuffer their Children to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Prieſts of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>they deferred the doing thereof, as long as they could poſſibly, becauſe they had in deteſtation thoſe humane inventions, which were added to that Holy Sacrament, which they held to be but pollutions thereof. And for as much as their Paſtors (which they called Barbes) were many
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42315:36"/>times abroad, in the ſervice of their Churches, they could not have the Sacrament of Baptiſm adminiſtred to their Infants, by their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: which the Prieſts perceiving, charged them thereupon with this Impoſture, which not only their Adverſaries have believed, but divers others, who have well approved of their life and Faith, in all other points.</hi> What can be more plain?</p>

                  <p> Again Book 2. Chap. 4. pag. 60, 61. <hi>We have but two Sacramental Signes, the which Christ hath left unto us: the one is Baptiſm, the other the Euchariſt, which we receive, to ſhew what our perſeverance in the Faith is, as we have promiſed, when we were Baptized, being little Infants.</hi>

The humane Authorities you produce (though ſome of them were Godly Men, yet) it is manifeſt, that the Authors admitted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other abſurd things concerning Baptiſm; and ſome of them (as you confeſs) deferred it a long time, after they were converted, out of a ſuperſtitious apprehenſion, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf did, and others that you Enumerate, <hi>p.</hi> 69. and their Baptizing <hi>Catechumens</hi> only at <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> And why might they not defer their <hi>Infants Baptiſm,</hi> out of the like ſuperſtition?

               <p n="5">5. That their ſilence in the firſt Centuries after Chriſt, concerning the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, is no conſiderable argument againſt it. <hi>A non dici, ad non eſſe, non valet conſequentia.</hi> But indeed it ſeems rather an Argument for it.

                  <p>The latter of the Teſtimonies you quote out of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> is plainly againſt you, and not contrary to what is in the former, but rather explains it. You ſay, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> affirms that in the Primitive-times,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42315:38"/>none were Baptized without an expreſs Covenanting, which ſhew's, that he ſpeaks of Adult-perſons in reference to other Adult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons, and not in reference to Infants. As if he had ſaid, thoſe Adult-perſons, were Baptized, that did expreſly-Covenant; other Adult-perſons, that did not ſo, were not Baptized. What doth this make againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, with whoſe parents God doth Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in reference to them? Or if you will; God Covenanteth with them; and they with him, mediately by their Parents.</p>
                  <p>Again; that in the days of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> Men had liberty to be Baptized, or to bring their Children, when, &amp; at what age they pleaſed. Is not this againſt you?

                  <p>Still of Adult-perſons you have taken much pains to prove, what we never deny; to wit, that Believers not yet Baptized ſhould be Baptized. The moſt of your Teſtimonies do not (in my ſmall judgment,) ſo much as hint, that Infants ſhould not be Baptized, or that Believers Baptiſm, is the only Baptiſm,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42315:41"/>which is the thing you undertake to prove.</p>
                  <p>And what is that word, which if taken away cauſeth Baptiſm to ceaſe? <hi>pag.</hi> 82. It muſt be either the Word (or Words) uſed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; to wit, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> or elſe, it muſt be the Word of the Covenant, to which Baptiſm as a Seal is annexed. And this is uſually opened to Adult-perſons, when they are to be Baptized, and to the Parents and the Congregation, when an Infant is to be Baptized, and is afterwards to be opened to the Child, when it is capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but obſerve many uncouth and <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> expreſſions and Similitudes of the Ancients concerning Baptiſm, that accord not with the Scriptures, which I believe, you would be as loth to own, as we are; though you uſe them as Rods to beat your Brethren.</p>

                  <p>Some of your Teſtimonies here (as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places) as I conceive, ſpeak not to the point at all. And others of them ſpeak againſt Baptizing ſuch, as have not really a true ſaving Faith, as well as againſt Infants. Some others are truly Popiſh.</p>

And though ſome, perhaps Godly and Learned, Baptized-Children, out of a conceit of the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm unto Salvation, and waſhing away Original Sin; yet that doth not prove that then Infants began to be Baptized.

                  <p>This Chapter labour's with the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, that the former ones did; to wit; ſo ſpeaking of Adult-perſons, as not to deny Infants.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Teſtimony againſt the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> who is it, that is acquainted with the Papiſt's writings, that is ignorant of the falſe accuſations they have laid upon the Proteſtants. See the Hiſtory of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> before mentioned, Book 1. Chap. 4.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe he ſaith true; Have not the <hi>Lutheran</hi>'s miſt it, in ſundry other things? And what if great multitudes of <hi>Catechumens</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:42315:42"/>be yearly Baptized at <hi>Rome?</hi> Is it ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict, and footſtep of Truth, as you would have it, to overthrow Infants-Baptiſm; which I have proved, to have grounds from the ſacred Scripture? And why is not Infant-Baptiſm rather, a Relict of Truth; for they uſe that alſo, yea and conſtantly uſe it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe <hi>Catechumens</hi> you mention, muſt either be ſuch, whoſe Parents (or Parent at leaſt) were not of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> or elſe they muſt be ſuch, as were Baptized in Infancy, and afterwards Rebaptized. And what if the <hi>Greeks</hi> defer the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? will that prove they ought not to be Baptized? 'Tis known how groſly they were in other matters of weight.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Beza's</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. what do they make to your purpoſe? Doth he ſay, No Children ſhould be Baptized, when he ſaith, All Children ſhould not be Baptized? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder at this Logick. Nor can I gueſs, why ſuch Impertinencies ſhould be brought in, unleſs it be to prevail with ſome more injudicious, who take things by Tale. Your candour might have ſeen, by the lines immediately foregoing, that <hi>Beza</hi> is croſs to your deſign; and it would have been your candour to have expreſt them, with the other. <q>Nec alia cauſa eſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> cur Sanctorum liberos, ad Baptiſmum admittamus, <hi>&amp;c.

Alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thoſe (are to be confuted) that admit all Infants to Baptiſm: thing unheard-of, in all the ancient Church; even this at leaſt ſheweth, that all Adult-ones, born of thoſe that were without, ought to be</hi> Catechumens <hi>before they were Baptized.

                  <p>As for <hi>Bucer,</hi> you mention not the page (which you alſo omit in divers others, that renders your Teſtimonies uncapable of any eaſy <hi>examen).</hi> It may be you have miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him, as you have ſome others.</p>
                  <p>As to that of <hi>Chamier;</hi> it makes againſt you, for, it implies, that ſome were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed before they came to age. Probably, the reaſon why others were not, might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Parents were without, (to uſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's</hi> words,) and were not Church-Members,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:42315:43"/>till after their Children were grown; as the Caſe was, at the firſt promulgation of the Goſpel among the Gentiles. Then perhaps ſcarce the 1000th. perſon might be Baptized, before he came to age. Or, there might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſome other reaſon, as we have before ſhewed among the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for that of Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> it lies upon you to prove, that their putting off their Baptiſm ſo long, was lawful, and according to God. Elſe you ſay nothing; or rather worſe than nothing; for it is but to bring an errour to overthrow a Truth, and to eſtabliſh an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> do well, to put off his Baptiſm, till a little before he died? How doth this prove, that Infants of Inchurched-Parents ſhould not be Baptized?</p>
                  <p>As to that in <hi>pag.</hi> 90, 91. I ſhall give a better reaſon, for the Baptizing of Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Parents Infants, than from their Sureties, which were an Invention of Men; and that is, the Faith and Repentance of one Parent at leaſt, ſo far manifeſted, as that they are received and owned of the Church; which regularly ſhould go before the Baptiſm of the Child.</p>
                  <p>As for the Baptiſm of Churches and Bells, <hi>p.</hi> 92. we leave it with ſuperſtitious and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Papiſts, it makes not againſt us. I ſhould be ſorry, that any ſhould look upon
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42315:43"/>the Baptiſm of Infants as they look upon them.</p>
                  <p>To the uſe you make of all, <hi>pag.</hi> 93. I ſhall only commend it to your ſecond thoughts whether it would not better agree with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity, and been more ſuitable to a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaldiſputant, and lover of the Truth, to have interpreted the ſpeeches of divers God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Learned-Men, in the plain ſence they intended them; which was only of Adult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons; and then to have brought your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments directly againſt the Intereſt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, wherein the Controverſie lies; and not to make them ſpeak, what they never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Then what they have ſaid, would not be found a clear evidence againſt themſelves nor againſt the Truth. But if any of them have ſaid, or granted any thing, which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants of Inchurched-Parents out of Chriſt's Commiſſion, I cannot be of their mind, for the reaſons before given. And ſo I ſhall end this with a Concluſion Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and flatly contradictory to yours; That Believers Baptiſm is not only to be eſteemed Chriſt's Ordinance of Baptiſm; or rather, to mend your phraſe, and ſpeak more Logically and Rationally; Believers Baptiſm is not to be eſteemed, Chriſt's only Ordinance of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>

               <p>IN <hi>p.</hi> 97. Whereas you ſay, ther's no Example or command in the Scripture, to warrant the Baptiſm of Infants, but the Scripture is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent therein, not one ſyllable, you ſay, to be found in all the New-Teſtament, of any ſuch practice; and therefore, it is no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Jeſus Chriſt:] beſides what hath been already ſaid, I ſhall firſt diſtinguiſh, and then deny your aſſertion; and lay down the contrary.</p>
               <p>I might firſt deny your Enumeration of particulars, as an inſufficient Induction (for a promiſe in Scripture, would be a ſufficient Warrant; as well as a Command, or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which you have left out:) But I ſhall haſten.</p>
               <p>Things may be truly ſaid to be, and to be commanded, in Scripture two ways;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Expreſly, in ſo many words. As <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go ye teach</hi> (or Diſciple) <hi>all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42315:44"/> 2. Implicitely, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47. Lo! ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we turn to the Gentiles, for ſo hath the Lord commanded us.</hi> And then he brings in Authority to prove it, from a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God the Father to Jeſus Chriſt; I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. and 42.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which the Apoſtle renders, <hi>I have ſet thee to be a light to the Gentiles, that thou ſhouldſt be for Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles preaching the Goſpel to the Gentiles, was a matter of greater import than the Baptizing of Infants, and part of the great myſtery of Godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. a Myſterious thing; and yet, he counted this Inference ſufficient Authority for him. Let this be the more carefully marked, becauſe Inferences and deductions from Scripture, concerning Infants-Baptiſm, are denyed.</p>
               <p>So for Examples; ſome are more expreſly and explicitly laid down: others more impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly and covertly. You have given inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the former; and I have given inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the latter. <hi>Lydia</hi> and her Houſe. The Houſhold of <hi>Stephanas</hi> Baptized.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Go ye and Diſciple all Nations, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them.</hi> Here is an expreſs-command to Baptize ſuch as are Diſcipled, but what this Diſcipling is, and who are theſe Diſciples, is not expreſly laid down here; but we muſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42315:45"/>look what may be gathered from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to give us light therein; which I have ſpoken to before.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction thus cleared, I muſt deny your Aſſertion, and poſitively affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; That there is a precept implied in the New-Teſtament, for the Baptizing of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents-Infants; and as clear, if not more clear, than that you produce, for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens receiving the Lord's Supper. You own the one, though the Command and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple you produce be very implicite, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with many things that occaſion doubting; and yet, you own not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe you may eaſily diſcern, that the Teſtimonies you bring out of <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and ſome others, have reſpect only to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command, and Example, and not to an implicit one. And therefore, if you had dealt like a candid, and punctual Antagoniſt, you would either have owned what they held and thought as they did, concerning an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Command, or elſe you would have contravened and oppoſed that only. As for <hi>Calvins</hi> judgment ſee his Inſtitutions. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>Artic.</hi> 5, 6, 7. He gives divers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove, that the Baptiſm of Infants was inſtituted by God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42315:45"/> 1. <hi>ſaith he,</hi> We have the ſame Promiſe, that <q>
                     <hi>Iſrael</hi> had heretofore in Circumciſion, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Therefore, they are not to be driven away from the ſign of Baptiſm, when they are partakers of the thing-ſignified. And then in the Article, he tells you, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the thing-ſignified to them.</q> 
                  <hi>Diſerte namque pronunciat Deus, Circumciſionem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantuli, loco ſigilli futuram, ad obſignandain foederis promiſſionem.</hi> That is, God expreſly ſaith, that the Circumciſion of a little Infant, ſhould be inſtead of a Seal to confirm the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond Argument to prove it to be inſtituted of God, is taken from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is common to us Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third Argument is taken from the Act of Chriſt, ſo courteouſly embracing the Infants, that were brought unto him. See there more at large. By all which it appear's that though <hi>Calvin</hi> might deny, that there was any expreſs Command for Baptizing of Infants; yet he held an Implicite Command; which is the thing, I was to evidence.</p>

               <p>AS for the Arguments, drawn from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Tradition, for Baptizing Infants; I leave them to thoſe, that are willing to build their Faith upon humane Tradition. But as for conſequential Arguments, deduced from Scriptures, to juſtifie the Baptizing of Infants, thoſe I muſt ſtick unto; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing can naturally, and <hi>(per ſe)</hi> of it ſelf flow out of the Scriptures of Truth but Truth. And every grain of Truth is to be prized above the World. And you have no more but Conſequences, to prove that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould partake of the Lord's Supper; and thoſe alſo much entangled, and obſcured with difficulties.</p>
               <p>I muſt profeſs, if conſequences be not valid, that naturally flow from Scriptures rightly underſtood, I know not what to make of much of the Holy Scripture; neither will you.</p>
               <p>As to that, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.13, 14. <hi>Calvin</hi> will tell you how Baptiſm comes to <q>
                     <hi>be concerned in it. Inſtitut.</hi> lib. 4. Chap. 16. Artic. 7. <hi>This is not lightly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be paſſed by,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42315:48"/>that Chriſt commandeth Infants to be brought unto him; adding a reaſon; to wit, becauſe of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he declareth his will by his deed; when having embraced them, he commends them to his Father, by his praying, (for them, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them. If it be meet, that Infants ſhould be brought to Chriſt; why not alſo, that they ſhould be received to Baptiſm? which is the badge of our Communion &amp; fellowſhip with Chriſt? If theirs be the Kingdom of Heaven, why ſhould the ſign be denyed them? &amp;c.</hi> See more there.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to that of <hi>John,</hi> 3.5. Let them plead for the Baptiſm of Infants from that Text, that ſee more than I do in it. I ſhall not ſide with them, nor conclude as they do, that there is no other way to Regenerate and ſave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; though I dare not exclude Baptiſm, if God pleaſe then to work.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhall I deduce the Baptiſm of Infants from <hi>Mark,</hi> 16.16. upon this ground, that they are Believers; or upon any other inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red habit of Grace within them (which is wholly hidden from man) having a clearer, ſurer, more ſolid, and viſible ground, to build upon, not only from Chriſt's Commiſſion, (as hath been proved;) but alſo from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, in a Church-way, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42315:49"/>repeated, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. together with the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> with Circumciſion, than the initiatory Seal of Gods Covenant, and diſpenſed to Infants; and alſo, from that fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holineſs mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. which you deny, and make it to be only a Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſuch Children.</p>
               <p>What if others ſaw it not in ages paſt, that Holineſs there is taken for federal Holineſs: Neither did you your ſelf ſee formerly many Truths, that now you do; and yet they were in the Scriptures then, as well as now. We have cauſe therefore to bleſs God, that hath given to any of his Servants to diſcern the Truths, that lay hid from the former Ages; and in particular, this among others, of the federal Holineſs of Children of Inchurched-Parents. I confeſs my ſelf, not ſo much an <hi>Antiquary,</hi> as to ſay, who was the firſt founder of this Interpretation; nor have I ancient Commentators at hand to examine; but if <hi>Zuinglius</hi> were the firſt (as you affirm) we have cauſe to honour him, and to bleſs God that revealed it to him. And now I come to anſwer to your reaſons given againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth not contradict the Goſpel-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; but well ſuits with it; the Lord not having ſtraitned, but enlarged his Grace, now in Goſpel-times, and the viſible tokens of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:42315:49"/> 2. This federal Holineſs of Infants of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents, is not an entayling Grace to Nature; nor Regeneration to Generation; but is an entayling of God's Covenant in it's External and Eccleſiaſtical diſpenſation, to the natural-Seed of Inchurched-Parents, which they ſhould improve alſo, for their Regeneration. It is therefore your miſtake, to take Grace] abſolutely, and only for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Grace; as if we held this Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to conſiſt in Regeneration, and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sanctification: For we acknowledge, that we and our Children, are all by Nature Children of wrath, as well as others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. But we and our Seed, being, at leaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, in God's-Covenant, have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage left us by our Gracious God, to preſs him for regenerating Grace for our Children, which he hath indefinitely and conditionally promiſed; And our Children when they come to diſcretion, for themſelves. This priviledge and advantage they want, who are ſtrangers from the Covenants of promiſe, as being without Chriſt, without hope, and without God in the World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. but being under the Covenant, they have a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground for their hope; which they ſhould improve, for converting-Grace, leaving ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things to God.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:42315:50"/>
               <p> If then you ask, what Holineſs this federal Holineſs is; It is a Relative Holineſs by way of ſeparation and Conſecration. God hath Externally-Conſecrated Inchurched-Parents and their Seed, to be his people, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending them within the External and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical-diſpenſation of his Covenant; and thereby hath entitled them to the Initiatory Seal thereof, the ſuſception of which, even infants are capable of.</p>
               <p>And here again I muſt mind you, that your Aſſertion doth neceſſarily imply, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is Baptized muſt be truly-regenerated, and ſanctified; which hath been often confuted before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence this federal Holineſs of Infants, doth not at all contradict the experience of former and latter times; as you ſay it doth.</p>
               <p>Had not <hi>Abraham</hi> an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> an <hi>Eſau?</hi> And yet both of them, when Children were federally Holy. What I pray did <hi>Eſau</hi> ſell, when he ſold his Birth-right, for which he is called a profane perſon? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. And what if Parent's now Inchurched neglect their Duty, and have Children, that when grown up, do ſlight their Priviledge, and walk wickedly, neglecting their Duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of God, as indiſpenſably-neceſſary to the eſtabliſhment of Covenant-Relation; and tranſgreſſing thoſe Commands they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42315:50"/>to obſerve? Is it not an aggravation of their Sin, that they were once Children, that were devoted and conſecrated to God? You will eaſily grant, that it was a great Sin to turn any conſecrated thing to a common and profane Uſe. And is it not ſo here? for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were externally conſecrated and related to God in his Covenant, to turn from him, in ſtead of ſeeking him; and to give up themſelves to Sin and Satan and the World? Doth not God tax the <hi>Iſraelites, Ezek.</hi> 16.20. <hi>Thou haſt taken thy Sons and thy Daughters, whom thou haſt born unto me,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and theſe haſt thou Sacrificed, &amp;c. And thou haſt ſlain my Children,</hi> v. 21. And how were they the Lord's, but by virtue of his Covenanting with them in their Parents, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and not only in common, by Creation? Here was ſomething, that was not common to Heathen-Children. And this will agree with our Interpretation of that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. of federal Holineſs, but not with your Inference which you would faſten upon us, as an abſurdity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence again, this federal Holineſs of Infants of Inchurched-Parents, doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate an owning of the Doctrine, of falling from Grace, as you infer; for when we ſay, They are federally Holy, we do not take it for Inherent-Holineſs, and ſanctifying Grace;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42315:51"/>Therefore, they cannot fall, from what they never had. But we grant they may fall from federal-Holineſs, by their ſinful ſlighting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting or mocking at the Covenant, and Heirs of the Promiſe, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did. I ſhall therefore return your Argument upon you; when you, in your way, Baptize Adult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons, upon certainty of Regeneration, and infallible Inherent-Holineſs (which you pretend to, and your Argument againſt us implies ſo much) and then afterwards they fall away (as your own experience will tell you; then, it is your opinion, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that holds the Doctrine of falling from Inherent Grace, and not ours. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who are Baptized in your way, do fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and are never renewed again unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>I cannot therefore concur, with your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor Interpretation of that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. You ſay it ſhould be read thus, <hi>The unbelieving Husband is ſanctified to the Wife: and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctiſted to the Husband.</hi> And you ſay the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth ſometimes ſignify ſo; and give an inſtance in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. where it is tranſlated <hi>among Men</hi>] you ſay, it ſhould be <hi>to Men.</hi> But by your favour; you muſt give us a clearer Proof, before we can receive it. That the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies <hi>among</hi>] is apparent in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42315:51"/>ſundry Scriptures. Take one for all, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. To whom God would make known, what is the Riches of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this myſtery among the Gentiles: <hi>viz.</hi> more generally; and more particularly among you <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> which is Chriſt among you, <hi>the hope of Glory.</hi> So I rather read the words than <hi>Chriſt in you.</hi> The word is the ſame in both. And this will give us light to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>No other name given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men]</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is the only Saviour, and God hath appointed, <hi>that he alone ſhould be preached among Men, that thoſe, that ſhould be ſaved, might believe on him, and others left without excuſe.</hi> This is Engliſh proper enough and ſuitable to other Scriptures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be tranſlated, and tied up, to the Word <hi>To</hi>] to maintain your opinion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the genuine ſence of the Text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any reaſon why <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould be rendred <hi>To], Gal.</hi> 1.16. It's very proper, and Emphatical, and I ſcarce ever heard, or read that Text applied, and opened by our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Divines, but they inſiſt upon the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. It pleaſed God, not only to reveal his Son <hi>To me,</hi> but <hi>In me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That we may find out the true and genuine ſence of the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Apoſtles ſcope, and his manner of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42315:52"/>arguing, which I find elaborately opened by Mr. <hi>Cobbet,</hi> the ſum of which I ſhall give you, with ſome little Addition thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other queſtions propounded to the Apoſtle, by the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> this was one. Whether perſons being unequally yoked, the believing party might abide with the Infidel; and with a good Conſcience might continue cohabitation, and conjugal-Communion?</p>
               <p>This he begins to Anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 12. forbidding the believing-party, to reject, or depart from the Infidel, if the Infidel were willing to continue; and that for four reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Inward and outward Peace, is furthered by ſuch cohabitation, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe thereby, an opportunity might be had, of gaining the Infidel-Party to the faith, <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſtians are bound to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their calling, <hi>v.</hi> 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. (Which is firſt in the Text, but I put it laſt, to avoid repetition) Becauſe, from ſuch cohabitation, and conjugal-Communion, no pollution of Conſcience, ariſeth to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-party; but on the contrary, a Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Infidel, not only <hi>To,</hi> but alſo <hi>In</hi>] the believing Party, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14. In this lay the great weight of their ſcruple;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42315:52"/>and therefore the Apoſtle backeth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this reaſon with another; which the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (that ſent to be reſolved in the Caſe) could not deny, but did own. The reaſon lies in theſe words; <hi>Elſe were your Children unclean, but now they are holy.</hi> That is, if the unbelieving party were not ſanctified in the believing one; your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would be unclean; but now they are holy, as you cannot deny; therefore it muſt needs follow, that the unbelieving party is ſanctified in the believing one. I ſhall open the words, by anſwering.</p>
               <p>—1. Negatively.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>Sanctified</hi>] here, is not meant, <hi>made Holy,</hi> by inherent Grace. That might poſſibly be the iſſue of it afterwards, but it was not ſo at preſent; for if it had, then the Queſtion would have been needleſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor by <hi>Sanctified</hi>] here is meant, a <hi>being made a lawful Husband, or a lawful Wife;</hi> for that they were before; and there was no ſcruple concerning that. They were lawful Man and Wife, when they were both Infidels as your ſelf do acknowledge, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-fellowſhip was honourable, and the Bed undefiled, yea even among <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Heb.</hi> 13.4. They had a lawful civil uſe of each other, when they were both of them Infidels; and that could not be denied,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42315:53"/>when one of them was a Believer. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a lawful uſe only were intended by the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> then one of theſe two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities would follow:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That either there is nothing in this Text peculiar to the Believing party, which is directly croſs to what the Apoſtle affirms. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Husband is ſanctified in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Wife,</hi> &amp;c. — Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Infidel-couples are ſanctified each in other; for, they were lawful man &amp; wife, when both of them were Infidels. How croſs are theſe to the holy ſpirit, ſpeakingin &amp; by the Apoſtle? — 2. Poſitively. By <hi>Sanctified in the Believing Husband,</hi> and <hi>in the Believing Wife</hi>] are theſe two things meant.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the believing-party had, and might have a ſanctified enjoyment, and uſe of the unbelieving. The civil enjoyment, and uſe of each other in a conjugal way, was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when they were both Infidels; but now one of them is a Believer, that believing party hath a Sanctified enjoyment, and uſe of the unbelieving One. The Infidelity of the one, doth not make that conjugal uſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was lawful, to become defiled, to the other that believes. Believers, as to all lawful things, have a lawful uſe of them, as they are Men; but they have alſo this more, than any Unbelievers have; to wit, a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:42315:53"/>Sanctified Uſe of them as they are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>To the pure all things are pure Tit.</hi> 1.15. that is, not only lawful; for ſo, Meat Drink, Phyſick, Plowing, Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are even to Heathens; but they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo holy, in and for the uſe of Believers. But to the impure, and Unbelieving, Meat, Drink, Apparel, Marriage, Plowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though in themſelves lawful, yet nothing is pure, and Sanctified to them, but even their Mind and Conſcience is defiled. <hi>The Plowing of the wicked is Sin, Prov.</hi> 21.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though this Sanctified Uſe and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, is neceſſarily implied, in that phraſe, <hi>Sanctified in the Believing Husband, and in the believing Wife</hi>] yet, that is not all; but there is ſomewhat more intimated, which is more to our purpoſe, and to the ſcope of the place; and why we ſhould loſe a grain of it, I ſee no reaſon.
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
                  </note> For both the Parents being (as it were) the common root of the Child, if both are unholy and unbelieving, the Child is unclean, in the Apoſtl's ſence. But ſaith the Apoſtle, If either the Father or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a Believer, the Child is not unclean but holy, notwithſtanding one of the Parents be an Unbeliever. For that Parent, which is an Unbeliever, is ſanctified in that Parent, which is a Believer. I ſay, ſanctified in him,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:42315:54"/>ſo, that by vertue of that Parent, who is a Believer, the other that is an Unbeliever, becomes with the Believing Parent, the root of an holy Child, as if he, or ſhe, were a Believer too; the Bleſſing following the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving party. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Parent is Sanctified In</hi>] the Believing one, and ſo, with the Believing one, is the root of an holy Seed. Hence we ſee, that there is no reaſon, why we ſhould change the ſignification of <hi>In</hi> into <hi>To];</hi> but great reaſon, why we ſhould give it, it's proper ſignification.</p>
               <p>As to that of <hi>Ezra,</hi> 10. It was an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation peculiar to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and before the Partition-Wall was broken down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the <hi>Jews</hi> only, and alſo, for that ſpace of time, is apparent; thus. An Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del-Husband turning Proſelite, was not bound to put away his Wife, though ſhe ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued an Infidel. And thus much to that phraſe, <hi>Sanctified in the Believing-Husband, and Sanctified in the Believing-Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, of the Childrens being Unclean, and Holy; I aſſert,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively, By <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean</hi>] here is not meant Illegitimate, or Baſtards, nor ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as have Sin in them; for ſo thoſe Children the Apoſtles calls Holy have.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:42315:54"/>
               <p> Nor by <hi>Holy</hi>] is meant Legitimate. Nor do the Scriptures you alledge make it good, From what I pray was the Baſtard, who was Illegitimate excluded? <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2. not from Legitimacy only, but <hi>from the Congregation of the Lord.</hi> He was accounted unclean, and unholy, in reference to that, and might not partake of the priviledges of the Covenant, as other Children might. He was not to be accounted federally-Holy, as other Children of the Jewiſh Church were which your ſelf doth grant <hi>p.</hi> 190.</p>
               <p>And as to that of 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. It doth not prove Legitimacy to be Holineſs, but there is ſomething more in it. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks not here to the Gentiles, <hi>that knew not God; v.</hi> 6. but to viſible Saints-Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who were (viſibly at leaſt, and in the judgment of Charity) <hi>in God the Father, and in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Chap. 1.1. And it was the Will of God, that they ſhould walk, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Civil and ſober manner (for ſo, many Gentiles did, that knew not God) but alſo in a Sanctified manner, that every one of them ſhould poſſeſs his Veſſel in Sanctification and Honour, even in their married-eſtate, and not in the luſt of Concupiſcence. God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that his people even in a married-eſtate, ſhould not only be honeſt, but alſo Holy. That they ſhould conſecrate themſelves

               <p>Take the ſum of the words in this enſuing Paraphraſe.</p>
               <p>Unleſs your Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, and your Faith therein, which in a Church-way ye profeſs, have ſo much influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on your Infidel Yoke-fellows, as to Sanctifie them, not only to your Conjugal Uſe, but alſo to Sanctifie them in you, (both of you being together, one Common-root of your Children) it cannot be of force to your Children, to render and denominate them Holy; but they muſt be unclean, as if ye had been both Infidels. But this latter ye do not queſtion, to wit, whether your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Holy? And therefore, why ſhould ye queſtion the other? to wit, whether you may conſcionably abide, and have Conjugal Communion with your Unbelieving-Yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow? This ſence of the Text is plain and clear and ſuitable to the Apoſtles ſcope.</p>
               <p>And hence; as long as this Covenant-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt holds in force; neither rejected by the Parents, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20) nor they ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor cut off by a juſt Church-Cenſure (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5.) nor by God's juſt hand (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15, 17.) even ſo long, as the Covenant is Eccleſiaſtically of force, to the Childrens federal and Church-Eſtate; ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8.20.21, 23. And thus I hope,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42315:56"/>I have cleared this much controverted Text of Scripture; wherein I ſuppoſe are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the main things that are brought againſt it; but yet I ſhall anſwer as briefly as I can to ſome particulars, that ſuch as are not ſo well able to diſcern them under other heads might ſee them here.</p>
               <p>To <hi>pag.</hi> 194. Argument ſecond. It ſeem's to me an unweighed and inconſiderate Aſſertion; to ſay, that the Holineſs of the Children, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. is of no other nature, than that ſpoken of the unbelieving Parent in the Text; and therefore, that if one will enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Ordinance, ſo will the other— This is neither conſiſtent with the Truth (as may be ſeen before) nor with your ſelf; for you tell us <hi>pag.</hi> 192. that the unbelieving-Husband's being Sanctified to his Believing Wife, is, that ſhe might freely-converſe with him in the Conjugal-Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Child, was his Legitimacy. Judge impartially whether theſe are the ſame.</p>
               <p>To your third <hi>Arg. p.</hi> 194, 195. That this Text is not to be limited to Infants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer; it is to be limited to Infants, and Children in minority. For if they be 30, 40, or 50. years old, as you ſpeak, they are to profeſs perſonally their Faith and Repentance, and to lay hold of the Covenant themſelves, before they can regularly be Baptized.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42315:57"/>
               <p> To your fourth Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 195. Why this federal Holineſs of Children (that we ſpeak of) cannot be a New-Covenant-Holineſs that muſt qualifie and entitle to Baptiſm; firſt, becauſe it cannot be known, ſay you, for the Parent profeſſing may be a Hypocrite—and then you Baptize a wrong Subject.—In An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which,—1. Though I am heartily ſorry in ſome reſpect, yet in another I am glad, to hear you ſpeak ſo plainly. In other places you are more dark and ſilent, but here you plainly expreſs your mind. It ſeem's then, you Baptize no Hypocrites; and I heartily wiſh you did not. Do you certainly and infallibly know, that all that are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in your way, are true real Chriſtians, and not Hypocrites? Surely that cannot be known by you. And why then are they Baptized? It's too apparent, that divers ſuch perſons are Baptized in your way. I pray conſider, how this your principle, and practice can conſiſt, and ſtand together. As for us, we know that ſuch Parents are Church-Members, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants we Baptize: but when you Baptize a Hypocrite, you Baptize a wrong Subject. <hi>Ex ore tuo, &amp;c.</hi>—2. We do not Baptize a wrong Subject, when we Baptize the Infant of an Inchurched-Parent that is an Hypocrite. He appears a Saint to the Church, and as ſuch they received him; his Hypocriſie is hid from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42315:57"/>them, as <hi>Judas's</hi> was from his fellow-Diſciples. A Member of the Church he is, and hath as good a right <hi>(in foro Eccleſiae)</hi> before the Church to all Church-Ordinances, as the moſt ſincere Chriſtian in the Church hath, both for himſelf and his Child.—3. That this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral-Holineſs, is a New-Covenant-Holineſs, and ſufficient to entitle the Child to Baptiſm. Is there not an External and Eccleſiaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the New-Covenant now, as well as an Internal and Spiritual? And is there not an Eccleſiaſtical and Church-Holineſs, (which Hypocrites may have as well as true Saints) which is alſo a New-Covenant-Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Whereby they have an external-right to New-Covenant-Ordinances? Hath not the Hypocrite Baptized in your way, a New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Holineſs? Is he not Externally in the New-Covenant, and therefore you admit him to be Baptized? you think alſo, that he is ſpiritually and ſavingly in the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but afterwards it appears you were miſtaken. And ſo, it is your Opinion, that tends to Baptize a wrong Subject, and not ours. We go upon more ſure, and certain grounds, and ſuch as may be known, and through Grace we know. Conſider good Sir, of theſe things, which in Love to the Truth, I preſent to your ſelf, and to others.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42315:58"/>
               <p> You add a ſecond Reaſon; thus, If this federal-Holineſs be a New-Covenant-Holineſs, that muſt qualifie, and entitle to Baptiſm, then no Unbelievers Child is in Covenant, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>I muſt profeſs, this is ſtrange Arguing; and wants a deal of Rational Glue to joyn the Conſequent to the Antecedent. When we ſpeak of federal-Holineſs; we ſpeak of what is Viſible, External, and Eccleſiaſtical, and if you have not taken notice of it formerly, I beſeech you obſerve it now; for I perceive, and have long obſerved, that the want of a right apprehenſion of this, is one great cauſe of difference, about Infant-Memberſhip and Baptiſm. But to your Argument. If you repeat the whole Syllogiſm, you will find four terms in it. The Antecedent of the Propoſition, ſpeaks of an External Right to Baptiſm; and the Conſequent is of a ſaving-Intereſt in the Covenant; and of Election, which is yet higher. We eaſily grant, that an Unbelievers or Pagans Child, may be Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from Eternity, and may be (if God pleaſe) ſavingly in the Covenant of Grace, and a true work of Grace in his Soul, in a way and time unknown to Man; and yet we can truly ſay, that ſuch an Infant, his Parents being Infidels, hath not that federal-Holineſs, which the Children of Inchurched-Parents
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42315:58"/>have, and ſo, hath not an Immediate Right to Baptiſm. For—1. He hath no Right by means of of his Parents; for they are both Infidels. —Secondly nor by his own profeſſion, for he is not capable of making any; and ſo the Church can have no knowledge of it. I grant he hath fundamentally a Right, but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally. <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> but not <hi>jus in re.</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Right, not an Immediate.</p>
               <p>It ſeem's to me by your expreſſion, and what I have heard from ſome others of your perſwaſion; That you make on's being in the Covenant, and Election, to run parallel, without diſtinguiſhing of the one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which I have obſerved, to be a cauſe of great miſtakes, eſpecially to many honeſt, and ſimple-hearted-Chriſtians, who are not able to ſee their way through it. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak ſomething to it.</p>
               <p>Election falls under a two-fold conſideration in reſpect of the Object unto which perſons may be ſaid to be Elected.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Eternal Life and happineſs, and the Graces of the Spirit, preceding it as means certainly tending thereunto, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To External Church-Ordinances and Priviledges, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Covenant is conſidered, as Internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſavingly Diſpenſed; or as Externally
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42315:59"/>and Eccleſiaſtically Diſpenſed. Now if you take both of theſe together, <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> in a compound ſence, then I grant, that the Covenant is no larger than the Vein of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they run parallel: But if they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> in a divided ſence, for Election only unto Eternal Life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Saving-Graces; then I deny them to be equal. For there is alſo an Election of ſome unto External Church-Covenant-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Priviledges, who are not Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Salvation. A Church-Member li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying in Hypocriſie, was within the Covenant Externally and Eccleſiaſtically diſpenſed. Elſe, how came he to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, which conſiſts by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is as the Cement that joyn's them together. Yet ſuch a One was never in the Vein of Election unto Eternal-Life; which is abſolute and not conditional, as ſome Blaſphemouſly hold.</p>
               <p>Hence, when it is ſaid, the Covenant is no larger than Believing] that is, It belongs to none but true Believers; It is thus to be underſtood, to wit, as to the enjoyment of the ſaving benefits of it, it belongs as Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to none but true Believers; but as to the External propoſal and tender of them, and Eccleſiaſtical and Temporary Priviledges of the Covenant, ſo, it may and doth belong,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42315:59"/>not only to true Believers, but alſo to ſuch as make a credible profeſſion of true Faith, in a viſible congregation, though they be not true Believers indeed; &amp; to their Children alſo.</p>
               <p>To conclude this; If the Covenant be no larger than the Vein of Election unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no larger than true Believing, then ſome of theſe abſurdities muſt needs follow;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either there muſt be no Hypocrite in any viſible Church (for he is not in the Vein of Election to Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and therefore,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.37, 38, 39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 47, 48, 49, 50.</note> not within the Covenant:) and this is flatly-contrary to the Scripture, and to known ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: ſee alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or if there be any Hypocrites in the viſible-Church, they muſt be certinaly-Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Salvation. For, Being in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church they are within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as hath been proved; and the Covenant being no larger than Election, they muſt of neceſſity be Elected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hypocrites in the viſible-Church, muſt be Damned or Saved. Damned they cannot be, becauſe they are within the Covenant, as I have proved. And the Covenant being of the ſame Latitude with Election, they are Elected to Salvation, and muſt not be Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or if they be, God muſt change his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42315:60"/>which is Blaſphemy even to think. —Again; Saved they cannot be; for God never Elected any unto Salvation, that lived and died Hypocrites, and he will not change his mind. And hence, according to that Tenet, Hypocrites can neither be Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor Saved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Covenant be no larger than Election unto Eternal Life and Salvation, and no Infants are in the Covenant, then all Infants-dying muſt be damned. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Opinion, they being not in the Covenant, are not Elected; and not being Elected, cannot be ſaved, unleſs the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God change his Decree; that is change himſelf. Hence we ſee, that what we hold, is free from that abſurdity; which you would faſten upon it, and the abſurdity lies at your own Door.</p>
               <p>But it ſeem's all my labour is in vain, that I have ſpent in proving this Holineſs of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. to be a federal-Holineſs; becauſe, ſay you, Be the Holineſe here what it will, it is neither here, nor elſe-where, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be a ground of Baptizing Children upon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I Anſwer, 1. That if this Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be federal (which you acknowledge all Children under the Law had); yea, I ſhall alſo add, as the Children Inchurched in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:42315:60"/>Family had, which was long before the Law) then if thoſe Children were by God's appointment, ſealed with the Initiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Seal, Circumciſion; the ſame Covenant, that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>being come upon us Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 3.14. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. Our Inchurched Children alſo, are to be Sealed with the Initiatory Seal of the Covenant, now under the Goſpel. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering this, that God hath never revoked it, but hath brought Baptiſm into the place of Circumciſion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. And you your ſelf grant ſo much implicitely, in ſaying that Circumciſion and Baptiſm ſerve to the ſame end; and that there is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy in ſome things betwixt the one and the other, <hi>Pag.</hi> 223.</p>
               <p>But 2. I have already proved out of Chriſts Commiſſion, that Inchurched-Parents Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are Diſciples, and ſo federally Holy, and by the ſame Commiſſion, to be Baptized. And the reaſon why Women and Females under the Law were not Circumciſed, nor commanded to be Circumciſed, was, becauſe of an Incapacity in Nature; they having no <hi>Praeputium</hi> or Foreskin, as the Males had; and what other Reaſon there might be, is hid from us. With Reverence I may ſay, It could not ſuit with the Wiſdom and goodneſs of God, dealing with his people in the way
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42315:61"/>of a Covenant of Grace, to command a thing impoſſible. I pray, what was there in the firſt Inſtitution of Baptiſm, in <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts time, concerning the Baptizing of Women? We hear nothing of them expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till a long while after, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12.—And as for their right to, and receiving of the Lord's Supper, I ſuppoſe we have ſhewn you as much obſcurity in it, as you can object to us, concerning the Baptiſm of Inchurched Infants.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. WHether Circumciſion called the Goſpel-Seal, did belong of old, to all in Goſpel-Covenant?</p>
               <p>—Firſt; you deny Circumciſion to be the Seal of the Goſpel-Covenant to all Believers, and ſo do I; there were many Believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Circumciſion was inſtituted; and ſo, they could not be Sealed by it.</p>
               <p>Be it ſo, that Circumciſion was tied to the Church in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Jacob</hi> and his poſterity. Might
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42315:61"/>not God do with his own what he would? What if God denyed it to others out of the Church in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, and afterwards in <hi>Jacob's</hi> poſterity, that people might joyn themſelves to them as Proſelytes; which is moſt probable? Are not many Believers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Seals of the Covenant now, becauſe they do not, or cannot joyn themſelves to a Goſpel-Congregation? Will you therefore deny Baptiſm, and the Lord's Supper, to be the Seals of the Goſpel-Covenant, to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers? Are they not inſtituted of God, to be Seals unto them, if they come in a right way to enjoy them?</p>
               <p>Again you ſay, there were ſome to whom the Covenant, did not belong, who received that, called the Seal of Circumciſion; as <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael.</hi> You indeed Anſwer this your ſelf in the next words, when you ſay, <hi>This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was not to be</hi> Eſtabliſhed] <hi>with him, but with Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 17.20, 21, 25. <hi>It was not to be</hi> Eſtabliſhed <hi>with him</hi>] to be made to ſtand and abide with him. He doth not ſay, that the Covenant, in that External-Diſpenſation, did not belong to <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or that he was not in the Covenant, in that Eccleſiaſtical admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it, when he was Circumciſed: from what was he caſt out? was it not from the Covenant, (againſt which he mocked in <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 21.9, 10.) and from the Church
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42315:62"/>and the External Priviledges of it, in which he was Externally before? Here you again miſs it, becauſe you do not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant in its ſeveral adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Some of thoſe you mention, that you ſay, were not Sealed with Circumciſion, were within the Covenant Spiritually and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly; others that were Sealed, were in the Covenant Eccleſiaſtically and External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to which latter ſort alone Circumciſion was annexed. Some were only Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in it, and ſome others, were both. And ſome only Spiritually and not Externally and Eccleſiaſtically. — Your Argument therefore, makes not againſt us at all; for you ſpeak not <hi>ad idem;</hi> and ſo, there can be no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.

               <p>This Anſwer concerning <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> will ſerve to the reſt; and I ſee no cauſe to doubt, whether the New-Covenant-Promiſes, under this Eccleſiaſtical-Diſpenſation, did belong to all the ſtrangers in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Houſe, that were Circumciſed, according to God's appointment.

To which the ſum of your Anſwer, is, that the Covenant in</hi> Gen. 17. <hi>was a mixt-Covenant, as the Seed was; which you thus explain; to wit, as</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe, ſtood in a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Capacity; to wit, The Father of a Nation to wit, the natural Iſraelites: So to be alſo a a Father of many Nations, comprehending the Spiritual</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whether Jews, or Gentiles: And ſo accordingly the Promiſes</hi> (ſay you) <hi>were of two ſorts; ſometimes reſpecting his natural Seed, whether Domeſtick or National, who were</hi> (ſay you) <hi>Typical of the Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and others again, reſpecting in a peculiar-manner, the ſpiritual Seed, the Family of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> viz. <hi>the Elect of whom, through Chriſt he was Father, and which are Evangelical, and in ſpecial manner, belonging to the New-Covenant — And hence you infer, that much of the miſtake and errour lies in this, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that to the one, which belongs to the other, for want of diſtinguiſhing the promiſes, that are often ſo mixed, that the one may be taken for the other.</hi>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>I ſhall firſt gather up the ſum of this, into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers poſitions, and then give in my Anſwer.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſay, The Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. was a mixt Covenant, to wit, becauſe the promiſes of it were partly of Temporal, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42315:63"/>of Spiritual things. I ſuppoſe this to be your meaning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Seed was; and ſo you make the Covenant to depend upon the Seed, which you ſay, were Natural-Iſraelites, or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual-<hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Elect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You ſay, the Natural Seed, was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of the Spiritual.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Temporal Promiſes reſpected his natural Seed, and the Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ones, his Spiritual Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> Elect and true Believers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And that theſe Spiritual and Eternal (or Promiſes of Eternal and Spiritual Bleſſings) do in ſpecial manner belong to the New-Covenant now in theſe Goſpel-days. I judge this to be the ſum, of what you aſſert.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>To which I reply.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. was no more a mixt Covenant, than the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is now, in theſe Goſpel-days. The New-Covenant doth not now exclude Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings. <hi>Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of this Life, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. The Lord indeed then, made them an expreſs Promiſe of Temporals, <hi>the Land of Canaan,</hi> which was alſo a Type of Heaven: and Promiſes of Spiritual and Heavenly things more covertly and ſparingly. And now he makes Promiſes of Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42315:63"/>things more clearly; expreſly, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and of Temporals more implicitely and ſparingly. May not you as well call this a mixt-Covenant?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Covenant doth not depend upon the Seed, (as you intimate) but the Seed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Covenant. The natural Seed then, were the natural Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the poſterity of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> through <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and his poſterity. And theſe Natural-Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were alſo his Church-Seed; and to theſe the Covenant Externally-belonged, as alſo to the Proſelyts and their Children. The Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that were Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Eternal Salvation, were alſo a part of that Natural and Church-Seed. God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a God to both in a diverſe reſpect. And ſo he is now in theſe Goſpel-days, if rightly-underſtood. Goſpel-Churches are the Church-Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God is their God Externally in Covenant, as he was to the Church of old. And he is the God of the Spiritual-Seed, that are now thoſe that are Elected unto Salvation: to both in a diverſe reſpect, as before. And your not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, is the fundamental cauſe of this Controverſie; which yet is ſo plain, that I know not how you can deny it. For are not Hypocrites in Goſpel-Churches, the Church-Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who profeſs ſuch a Faith
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42315:64"/>as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, though they have not the Truth and reality of it? Hypocrites they are; and yet you look upon them as within the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore you Baptize them; and yet, they prove not to be ſo at laſt. I have ſpoken largely to the ſubſtance of this before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You ſay, The natural Seed, was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical of the Spiritual. As the Birth of <hi>Iſaac</hi> (to wit; not by ſtrength of Nature, but by Promiſe; which did prefigure thoſe, that are born of the Spirit, and that look for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Life alone by Faith in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> I ſuppoſe this is your meaning, according to <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.23, 24, 25, 26.)—To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>That this Spiritual Seed (which you ſay, is typified by the natural) as it reſpects Goſpel-times, is to be conſidered, either as ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; or as ſuch in ſhew, and appearance only, in the judgment of the Church, (who are to judg after the ſight of their eyes, and the hearing of their Ears, and cannot look directly into the heart, and know <hi>(â priori)</hi> as Chriſt doth by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Godhead.)
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa</hi> 11.3.</note> And thus it makes not againſt us but for us, and againſt you. For, do not Goſpel-Churches conſiſt of the one, as well as of the other? Nay, when Chriſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42315:64"/>ſhall come again, will not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven (to wit ſome Goſpel-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es) conſiſt all of them of fooliſh Virgins; which ſhall have Oyle in their Lamps, to wit, a profeſſion and outward appearance of true Faith and Grace; but no Oyl in their Veſſels; none of the Spirit and true Faith, and Grace, in their Hearts? <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What can be more plain?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Temporal Promiſes, ſay you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected his Natural Seed, and the Spiritual and Eternal-ones, his Spiritual-Seed; <hi>viz.</hi> the Elect and true Believers.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>For Anſwer to which,</head>
                  <p>The Temporal-Promiſes included in that Covenant of Grace, which was diſpenſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in a Church-way, reſpected his Natural Seed, no otherwiſe (as I conceive) than as they were, and ſhould continue, his Church-Seed. For though <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Hagar,</hi> were at preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant in a Church-way diſpenſed, and alſo Circumciſed; yet God would not eſtabliſh his Covenant with him, but with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 17.19, 21. Nevertheleſs God gives this as an overplus, and by the By, in Anſwer to <hi>Abraham's</hi> requeſt; <hi>I have bleſſed him</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> with outward things which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called Bleſſings, and they are materially ſo) <hi>and will make him fruitful, and will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42315:65"/>him exceedingly, &amp;c. v.</hi> 20. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to <hi>Eſau,</hi> the bleſſing that God gave him, was not the Bleſſing of that Covenant (for <hi>Jacob</hi> had all that before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.27, 28, 29.) in alluſion to which, ſeems that Speech of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Eſau, I have all.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">So the Hebrew. <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> But another by-the By] <hi>v.</hi> 39.40. The Temporal Promiſes of the Covenant therefore, reſpected not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural-Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> any further than they were, and continued to be his Church-Seed.</p>
                  <p>Nor did they reſpect his Natural Seed only, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his Spiritual (to uſe your terms) for the Spiritual. Seed were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Church-Seed alſo, &amp; had thoſe Promiſes of Temporal things, as well as the others had. See both proved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.5. <hi>He hath given Meat unto them, that fear him, he will ever be mindful of his Covenant:</hi> Spoken of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Iſraelites, who did not all of them ſavingly fear him as ſome of them did; but they did at leaſt Externally ſerve him, and worſhip him in his own Inſtitutions, which is uſually called fearing him. Both to the one, and the other of them, he gave Meat out of Covenant; as he alſo did give them <hi>Canaan,</hi> the <hi>Heritage of the Heathen, v.</hi> 6. And hence, when they fell to Idolatry or neglected God's pure worſhip. And Externally brake God's
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42315:65"/>Covenant, he brought Temporal-Judgments upon them, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.10. to 15. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15. to the end: and <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. See alſo <hi>Judg. Chap.</hi> 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, though it be true, that only the Spiritual Seed, true Believers, had the ſaving good of thoſe Spiritual and Heavenly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Covenant; Yet in the Tender and outward Propoſal of them, they were held forth to the whole Church; and their Sins were the more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.16.24.</note> that they deſpiſed them. Even as they are now alſo in Goſpel-days, and their Damnation the greater, <hi>John</hi> 3.18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>The ſum then is briefly this. Both the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral &amp; Spiritual Promiſes of the Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Church Indefinitely; but none of them do ſavingly-partake of the Spiritual and Heavenly ones, but thoſe that truly-Believe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did. Promiſes are either tending to Converſion and Union, or there are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Communion. The former belong to the Unconverted, the latter to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted only, as to the enjoyment of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly Benefits held forth in them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That theſe Spiritual and Eternal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, (or rather Promiſes of Spiritual and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42315:66"/>Eternal Bleſſings) do in ſpecial manner belong to the New-Covenant, to wit, now in theſe Goſpel-days. I judge this to be your meaning. And I can grant the Words in a ſafe ſence, if I may be my own Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But your ſcope is, to prove the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the New-Covenant now, to be only Spiritual and Heavenly, belonging only to true Believers, and not to others, thereby to thruſt out Infants out of the Goſpel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and from Baptiſm the Seal of it.— Now, though I have already ſaid, what I hope may ſatisfie impartial-perſons, and ſuch as are not prepoſſeſt; yet doth not this your ſcope, really cut off Hypocrites, as well as Infants.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this, I ſhall add a word to your Inference and Concluſion, That much of the miſtake and error, lies not in this (as you affirm) by applying that to the one, which belongs to the other; for want of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the Promiſes as you would have them diſtinguiſhed; but for want of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, between the Spiritual-Saving Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Covenant of Grace, and the Eccleſiaſtical only: Or, as ſome others word it; Between the Covenant of Grace conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abſolutely in it ſelf, or cloathed with Church-Covenant, that is, conſidered in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a Viſible-Church-Eſtate. And thus
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42315:66"/>beſides what hath been ſaid to it before, you have alſo an Anſwer to your third Queſtion, to wit, Whether the Seed mentioned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. were <hi>Abraham's</hi> Natural or Spiritual Seed? only, I ſhall add a word to your evil and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conſequences as you term them, <hi>pag.</hi> 211, 212, 213.</p>
                  <p>If God made his Covenant of Grace, with the Poſterity of Believers, (as this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſay you, aſſerts) then, all the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Believers, ſhould have Grace beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them; that is, as your after-words and the ſcope of your diſcourſe implies; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saving-Grace, oppoſite to Children of wrath by Nature. To which I reply;</p>
                  <p>It doth not follow, that hence, all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteity of Believers, ſhould have Inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saving-Grace, beſtowed upon them; but External Covenant-Grace. See <hi>Malachy</hi> 1.2. <hi>I have loved you,</hi> ſaith the Lord to the body of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the poſterity of <hi>Jacob. Yet, ye ſay, wherein haſt thou loved us? was not</hi> Eſau Jacobs <hi>Brother, ſaith the Lord? yet I loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and I hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and laid his Mountains and his Heritage waſt, for the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons of the Wilderneſs, v.</hi> 3. What was this Love, as to the Body of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (many of which had no Saving-Grace within them) but External Covenant-Grace? <hi>He ſhewed his words unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42315:67"/>unto</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7, 8. And doth not <hi>Jacob</hi> thankfully acknowledge this great favour of God to his Poſterity, in ſaying to <hi>Joſeph, The bleſſings of thy Father, have prevailed, above the bleſſings of my Progenitors, Gen.</hi> 49.26. For, this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Grace was beſtowed on all <hi>Jacob's</hi> Sons, and to run along in their Poſterity, and none of them rejected, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> and their Poſterities were, even from this Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Covenant-Grace; until by their neglect of performing their Duty, they deprived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Children of it. You cannot but know this to be the ſence of thoſe, that plead for Infant-Baptiſm, that have ſearched ſo much into their Writings; and I cannot but wonder, that you harp ſtill upon the wrong String. Nor do thoſe words you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (to wit, <hi>that the Child of a Chriſtian is a Chriſtian</hi>) if taken in a right ſence, and as he intends it, at all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, either the Scripture, that ſaith, <hi>We are Children of wrath by Nature;</hi> or former and latter experience. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Child of wrath by Nature; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> being a <hi>Jew</hi> by Nature, and not a Sinner of the Gentiles and Heathens, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.15. was under this Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Covenant-Grace which the Gentiles then were not, <hi>who were Strangers from the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42315:67"/>of Promiſe, and Aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael,</hi> in the 12th. verſe of the very ſame Chapter. Overthrow this Truth if you can.</p>
                  <p>Again, another of your Inferences, is, If God made his Covenant of Grace, with the Poſterity of Believers, then, ſay you, would Grace be a Birth-priviledge, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation tied to Generation, contrary to <hi>John</hi> 3.3. and <hi>John</hi> 1.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>This hath been fully Anſwered to before. This External-Covenant-Grace we hold, is a Birth-priviledge of the Children of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents; and is an advantage, to Parents to cry to God for Converting-Grace for their Children; and a ſtrong engagement to them, to train them up in the way of the Lord: and to Children when grown to cry to God for Converting-Grace for themſelves. <hi>The Lord thy God, will circumciſe the heart of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy God, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>
                  <p>Again you infer; Then muſt all the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Believers be ſaved, unleſs you will hold falling from Grace.] To which I reply; that what hath been already ſaid, will eaſily An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this. It doth not at all, yield ſuch an Inference. But this we may ſafely ſay, and hold, that the Poſterity of Inchurched-Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, have an advantage tending to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42315:68"/>and Salvation, that other Children have not; &amp; it will be their great ſin, &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Condemnation, if they improve it not. Nor do we hereby, neceſſitate the Doctrine to be true, that Men may fall from Grace; that is, from inward ſanctifying Grace. They may indeed fall from that outward Covenant-Grace; as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> did; But as we do not hold this, to be Inward Sanctifying Grace; ſo we cannot neceſſitate the Doctrine to be true, that Men may fall from it; for then they muſt fall from what they never had.</p>
                  <p>Another of your Inferences is; Then muſt we tie up, and confine the Grace of God's Covenant, to the Children of Believers only; and then, what hope, ſay you, for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Unbelievers? Contrary to the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all Ages, &amp;c. To which I return, which alſo hath been mentioned before;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Grace is — either External Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Grace: or Internal, Spiritual and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace. We do not tie up (by our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net) the Internal, Spiritual and Saving-Grace, to the Children of Believers only, but leave unto the Soveraign Lord his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Royal, to beſtow his Grace upon whom he will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But this I muſt affirm; that Infidel-Parents, and their Children, want that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42315:68"/>that Chriſtian Inchurched-Parents, and their Children have. I pray, what Viſible help have you that deny this, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage your Faith to Believe, and put you on to pray, for the Converſion and Salvation of your Children. What? no Promiſe from God concerning them, in which you may wreſtle with him in their behalf? and no Promiſe left for them, to further them in it, any more than Children of Heathens? This were ſad indeed. I bleſs the God of all Grace I have experienced the contrary; and do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I knew a Godly Parent of your perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, who was ſadly perplext about the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſtate of a dying-Infant. What viſible ground of hope have we for dying Infants, if there be nothing left us in Gods-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>Your laſt Inference is; Then is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace overthrown, concluding an Intereſt without Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.14. derivng a Title by natural Generation. To which I reply, that hath been Anſwered already. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace is not thereby overthrown, but eſtabliſhed. For — 1. The Faith of one Inchurched-Parent at leaſt, hath been viſibly profeſſed, and the Covenant viſiby-accepted; which hath given an Intereſt to the Child. — And 2. Hence, the Natural Legitimate Child of ſuch a Parent, hath thereby a viſible
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42315:69"/>Title; which is that we plead for.</p>
                  <p>Then you come, <hi>pag.</hi> 213. to that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. which you grant, if rightly-underſtood, to be Parallel with that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. But I cannot agree with you in your ſence of it. For, firſt, what you ſay, agrees not with the Truth.—Secondly, nor with your ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not with the Truth. For, the Promiſe there ſeems not the Promiſe of the Spirit, in thoſe extraordinary gifts of it, wherewith God adorned the Church then; mentioned out of <hi>Joel,</hi> 2.28. For firſt, that Promiſe of Extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, doth not belong to all Believers and Inchurched-Parents in all Ages, as that other doth, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.—Secondly, nor is effectual-Calling the only condition of obtaining thoſe Extraordinary Gifts. For many that were and are effectually-called, had them not, and ſome might then have them, that were not effectually called; as is apparent in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23.—Thirdly, Remiſſion of ſins is here Promiſed to all theſe Jews, and is here held forth to them as Externally belonging to them, to urge them to Repent and Believe; which is not ſo much as named, in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. —Fourthly, it is apparent, that the Guilt of that curſed wiſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.25. <hi>His Blood be upon us, and our Children</hi>] did ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42315:69"/>them; and occaſioned the Apoſtle, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs-Terms to mention that promiſe to them &amp; to their Children, which the Promiſe of thoſe Extraordinary Gifts, could not cure. They were <hi>prict in their heart v.</hi> 37. For that great Sin eſpecially, and needed remiſſion of ſins; and wounded for that curſe, they had wiſhed upon their Children; and the holding forth of this Promiſe, was, to oure them both; which thing the other of Extraordinary Gifts, could not do. — Fifthly, though Sons and Daughters might fall under the notion of their Children; yet Old men mentioned as diſtinct from them could not ſo, which yet are mentioned in <hi>Joel</hi> 2. Theſe two Scriptures then, ſpeak not to the ſame thing and ſo are not the ſame Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet, if any do ſtill ſuppoſe them to be the ſame; let them read what Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> hath ſaid upon that Text, in his Book for Infant-Baptiſm. Thus I have ſhewn, why I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that your interpretation of that place in <hi>Joel,</hi> doth not agree with the Truth, in making it the ſame with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall now ſhew, that it doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with your ſelf. In <hi>pag.</hi> 213. You ſay, that that Promiſe <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. is the giving of the Spirit, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. and doth follow
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42315:70"/>the Receiving of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and the obeying his Commands, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Gal:</hi> 3.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32. Therefore (ſay you) <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts them to Repentance and Faith, in order to the receiving of it.— And afterwards you ſay, therefore the Promiſe (to wit, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.) is not made but upon condition of Calling, and Faith and Baptiſm. And in <hi>pag.</hi> 214. The Promiſe, is given as a Motive, why they ſhould Repent, and be Baptized. I muſt confeſs my weak under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot reconcile them. Review them more diſtinctly and judg of them.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. is the giving of the Spirit, propheſied, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Promiſe follows the receiving of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> Exhorts them to Repentance and Faith in order to the receiving of it.</p>
                  <p>The (ſame) Promiſe is not made but upon condition of Calling, Faith and Baptiſm, and yet, the (ſame) Promiſe given as a Motive, why they ſhould repent and be Baptized; I muſt acknowledge I cannot apprehend, how they can conſiſt. Let him reconcile them, that hath a larger reach than I have.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have been ſhewing, what that Promiſe, (held forth to thoſe prick't-hearted Jews) was not; rather than what it was. I now come to give you, by the aſſiſtance of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42315:70"/>Chriſt, what I conceive, to be the mind of God in it.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Promiſe</hi>] in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 17. is clearly meant, the Covenant of Grace. And that it is ſo to be taken here, is evident by this; becauſe it hath Baptiſm, the Seal of the Covenant now in Goſpel-days, annext unto it; and alſo, holds forth Remiſſion of Sins. <hi>Repent, and be Baptized for the Remiſſion of Sins; for the Promiſe is to you, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Promiſe or Covenant of Grace, unto which they had External and viſible Right, is here urged upon theſe Jews, to move them to Repent, and in that I agree with you; and not as a Condition if they did Repent. It's urged as a Motive, not as a Condition. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the Promiſe is to you. See the like <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. <hi>Ye are the Children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with our Fathers; Repent therefore and be Converted, v.</hi> 19. For to you firſt, God hath raiſed up his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to bleſs you in turning you a way from your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, <hi>v. ult.</hi> And why firſt, but becauſe they were the Children of the Covenant that God made with their Fathers? This ſence and ſcope of the Text is plain, and rational, and ſuitable to the ſcope of the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, that by Children there, is meant Poſterity; my Child is my
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42315:71"/>Child ſay you, though he be forty or fifty years old.] Yet, let me tell you, that ſuch Adult-Children, are by Gods Ordinance, if not Baptized already, to be Baptized upon their own profeſſion, and not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Parents; as you your ſelf do grant; and therefore it muſt be meant of Children in Minority. However, I hope, you will not exclude little Children, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of Poſterity, and ſo, will grant them their ſhare in it at leaſt.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>theſe afar-off</hi>] is plainly-meant the Gentiles, Eph. 2.11, 12. (And perhaps alſo the ten Tribes, who were long before divorced, and as to their preſent Condition, not then actually in External-Covenant with God.)</p>
                  <p>The Promiſe to them afar-off; doth not preſuppoſe them to be already-called; but it is to them at preſent, as by the Lord, they might be called afterwards. Here was now a way opened by Chriſt, to preach, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel to them, which before was not, though as yet, it was not actually-ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to them, unleſs to ſome few; untill the Jews ſhould actually reject it, and God reject them for rejecting it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore we may obſerve a difference between theſe Jews and their Children, and thoſe, that were yet afar-off, and their
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42315:71"/>Children; for though the Promiſe were then to them all (as the Word <hi>Is</hi>] doth intimate; yet not them all] in every reſpect, alike. It was now at preſent, to thoſe Jews, and their Children, Actually, Viſibly, and External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before Men. But to them afar off, Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally and before God; and ſhould be Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to them, and to their Children, (as now it was to the Jews, and their Children) when God ſhould Actually call them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Jews and their Children, were not yet diſcovenanted, and Unchurched, though they had deſerved it. See <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22, 23, 23, 36.</p>
                  <p>And this was after Chriſt's Death, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and Aſcenſion into Heaven, that theſe words are ſpoken to them, and that by the Holy Ghoſt, in the mouth of the Apoſtle. They were not afar-off, as the Gentiles (and probably the ten Tribes were at that time; who were then Strangers from Actual-External Intereſt in the Covenants of Promiſe; until ſuch time as God ſhould Actually-call them. But theſe Jews were nigh, as to their Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Covenant-Station, the External-Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Covenants, and Promiſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. though Really in themſelves Children of wrath, and bad enough, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>But how can it be ſaid, that it is] now, to them that are afar-off, when it had not yet reach ed them?</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:42315:72"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was then ſo,—1. In God's Intention and purpoſe. It was then ſo, in <hi>foro Dei;</hi> before God.—2. It was ſo then, becauſe Chriſt had opened the way, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down the partition wall, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15. which before ſtood between Jews and Gentiles. The way was ſhut before; but now opened, that Chriſt might be made known unto them.—And Thirdly. It ſhould not be long, before Chriſt would ſend out his Ambaſſadors to call them in; and then they ſhould Actually-enjoy this priviledge, both for themſelves, and their Children, as thoſe Jews then did. For what reaſon is there, that their Children ſhould be left out, any more than the Children of theſe Jews, when they were brought into the fellowſhip of the ſame Covenant for the Subſtance, where there is no difference between Jew and Gentile, Scythian, Barbarian, Bond and Free? This Call then, hath Reference to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who were yet Actually afar-off, Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenants of Promiſe, and not to theſe Jews, who were Externally within it, and their Children alſo.—To prove this yet a little more, take notice, that in the Scripture, God makes over External Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Grace, as in the preſent, to them that are not yet in Being, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.14, 15. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with you, ſaith the Lord, do I make this
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42315:72"/>Covenant, but with him, that ſtandeth here this day; that is, the Jew and Proſelyte, and the little ones (ſee the Text) that were preſent: and alſo with him, that is not here with us this day; to wit, thoſe that are yet unborn, as well as thoſe that might be abſent. With both, ſaith the Lord, do I at preſent make my Covenant. In the Parents of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born-Children it was done at preſent Actually before Men;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide</hi> Mr. <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi>
                     </note> but as to thoſe unborn Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Intentially before God.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of all is briefly comprized in this Paraphraſe.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſe, or Covenant of Grace, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally-adminiſtred, is [now] Actually to the Jews, &amp; to your Children on whom you wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Curſe of the Blood of Chriſt: and it is alſo at preſent (Intentionally &amp; before God, &amp; alſo preparatively before men, Chriſt having now opened the way; it is I ſay at preſent) to <hi>them that are afar off,</hi> (to wit, the Gentiles, (and probably alſo the ten Tribes); even as many (who are yet Externally Strangers from the Covenant) as the Lord our God ſhall call. When God's time is come to call them, the Goſpel ſhall be then ſent among them, to call them in; and to all ſuch, as obey that call, the Covenant ſhall at leaſt Externally,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42315:73"/>Actually be unto them and their Children as it is now unto theſe Jews and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>And here let me alſo ſhew you the Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of your Conditional ſence of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which you mention before; thus, the Promiſe is to you Jews, if you Repent and Believe: and to your Children, if they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and Believe; and to thoſe that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call; to wit, if they Repent and Believe. For, thoſe words, <hi>As many as the Lord our God ſhall call</hi>] being according to this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>exegeſis,</hi> expoſition and limitation of all that went before, and in your ſence, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for effectual Calling only, it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be added. And then this muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that one may be effectually called, and yet not Repent and Believe; whereas Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith, are infallible fruits of effectual Calling. Beſides, here is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſurdity will alſo follow, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and Covenant of Grace (as we have ſhewed, it is) doth not belong unto them, until they were alſo Baptized; for that alſo is mentioned, together with Repent. And then it will follow, that one muſt be Baptized before he hath any Way, Right, and Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace; which indeed is, according to the Proverb, to put the Cart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Horſe.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:42315:73"/>
                  <p> Having thus opened, and cleared that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. I ſhall now argue from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> That part of Mankind, which was once by God's appointment Externally in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſealed with the ordinary Initiatory Seal of that Covenant, and were not caſt out by Chriſt at his coming, but on the contrary confirmed therein; have ſtill by God's appointment an External-Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, both in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> and in the ordinary Initiatory-Seal thereof, now in theſe Goſpel-days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aſſump.</hi> But Children of Inchurched-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are a part of Mankind, which was once by God's appointment Externally in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſealed with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Initiatory Seal of that Covenant, and were not eaſt out by Chriſt at his coming, but on the contrary confirmed therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſion.</hi> Therefore, Children of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents, have ſtill by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment an External Intereſt both in the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the ordinary Initiatory Seal thereof, now in theſe Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is apparent; as hath been already ſhewed. And if you deny it, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of you, in the name of the Lord, to ſhew us out of the Holy Scripture, when, or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42315:74"/>where, Chriſt by his coming caſt them out; either by himſelf in perſon, or by any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployed by him. I have already ſhewed, that he did it not by <hi>John Baptiſt;</hi> nor by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; For, by them in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. he hath confirmed it. And that he did it not in his own perſon, appears by his courteous Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Infants brought unto him, and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Diſciples for hindering them to be brought. That they were once Externally in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant by God's appointment, is plain. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed, Gen.</hi> 17.7. That they were Sealed you your ſelf inſtance in <hi>Eſau, pag.</hi> 206. who, you ſay, was not in the Covenant, and yet Sealed, <hi>viz.</hi> with Circumciſion. See your Margin there, with that in the line. We ſhall add more, in replying to the fourth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition is plain and clear; If they were once intereſſed Externally, by God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, &amp; the Seal of it, &amp; not caſt out by Chriſt but by him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed therein; they muſt ſtill have an Intereſt in them. Thus much to your third Queſtion, and your Anſwers to it.</p>
                  <p>Now to your fourth Queſtion, and your ſence of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 4. Whether Circumciſion was a Seal of the New Covenant to the Children
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42315:74"/>under the Law? ſo <hi>pag.</hi> 205. But in <hi>pag.</hi> 216 you uſe other terms; <hi>viz.</hi> To the Believers and their Seed? You roundly deny it, to be a Seal to the Children; and much leſs a Seal to them of the New-Covenant. It was only ſay you, a ſign put into the fleſh of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; but a Sign and Seal only to <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 218. Your humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which you approve of, ſaith, It was a ſign to the reſt of the Jews, that they were <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed. That is, only that they were <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed muſt be your meaning, or elſe you ſpeak fallaciouſly.</p>
                  <p>To which I Reply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of what was it a ſign to <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed? was it indeed only that they were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi> natural Seed? was it not a ſign unto them of the Circumciſion of their heart, to love their Covenant-God, with all the heart and all the Soul? which God promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. and called for from them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. that they might improve it by ſeeking to God to do it for them? And were not their Parents to make the ſame uſe of it, in reference to their Children? How can you evade this? Nay, do not you your ſelf afterwards grant, <hi>p.</hi> 223. that Circumciſion ſignified Heart-Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And why not a Seal unto them alſo? Not that they did already Actually-Believe,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42315:75"/>as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, before he was Circumciſed; But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God was their God Externally in that Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. and would continue to be ſo, if they did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reject him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And that in particular, God would be found of them; if they ſought him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. and would not only Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the outward and Temporary Bleſſings of the Covenant to them, but alſo means of Grace; and not only ſo, but Converting-Grace by thoſe means, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>Thou</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son, know thou the God of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind.—If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee, but if thou forſake him, he will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You grant, <hi>pag.</hi> 217. that Circumciſion was a Seal, or Confirmation of that Faith, which <hi>(Abraham)</hi> had before; and to aſſure him, of thoſe ſpecial Promiſes, made to him, and his Seed, both Carnal and Spiritual.] It ſeem's then, you made not a full enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the particulars of which Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was a Seal to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>pag.</hi> 216. I would here ask you; Were not thoſe Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Seed Carnal, before they were Spiritual? If ſo, (as you cannot deny) was not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting-Grace for them promiſed and Sealed
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42315:75"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in his Circumciſion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this your Aſſertion? And ſeeing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> could not know the particular perſons, that ſhould be ſo made his Spiritual-Seed (nor any Man; elſe) in after-Ages, did not God therefore make the Promiſe of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Externally in general and Indefinitely;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</note> and Sealed it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed: that ſo, thoſe that were in Gods Eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be converted and ſaved, might through Grace, lay hold of it; and others, that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſlighted it, might be left without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe? If this were Sealed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſame Promiſe came along to his Seed, and they alſo had the ſame Seal, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had; how then comes it to paſs, that it ſhould not be a Seal to them alſo (who were ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-concerned in it) to aſſure them, that God would Circumciſe their hearts, if they ſought him in his own way? for, he ſaith, <hi>He will yet be inquired of, by the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to do it for them, Ezek.</hi> 36.37. with <hi>v.</hi> 26, 27. Bleſſed be God, I have heard a Child, upon his dying-Bed, plead this Covenant with God, for his Grace, to the great ſatisfaction of my Soul.</p>
                  <p>To come now to the Second part of your Anſwer; that as Circumciſion was not a Seal to Children under the Law; ſo much leſs a Seal
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42315:76"/>to them of the New-Covenant; ſay you, <hi>pag.</hi> 216. In ſtead of which, in <hi>pag.</hi> 218. you ſay, New-Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I like not the changing of your Phraſes, as you have done, in this Queſtion, and your Anſwer to it. You cannot but know, that there lies a fallacy in this Phraſe, as you have applied it here, and changed it. Pardon my boldneſs. I have before diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, of the New-Covenant; It may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken for the Covenant of Grace, in oppoſition to the Covenant of Works; or for the Covenant of Grace under the New-Teſtament-Diſpenſation, as oppoſed to that ſame Covenant under a more legal-Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. So it is called New, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8, 13. It being the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> revived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. freed from all thoſe legal Ceremonies, wherewith it was burdened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which have had their accompliſhment in Chriſt; and having only a few plain and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Ordinances annexed to it,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3.</note> ſuiting with a pure Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel adminiſtration; even as that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> had, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that Diſpenſation, before the Law was given.</p>
                  <p>This being premiſed, I Anſwer; That Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. was a Seal of the New-Covenant, to wit; the Covenant of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42315:76"/>Grace, as it was oppoſed to the Covenant of Works, made with <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: and alſo, as it was oppoſed to the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for the ſubſtance of it, under that Legal Adminiſtration at <hi>Sinai,</hi> and afterwards. And though there be a difference between the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, and the Adminiſtration of it now, under the New-Teſtament, in ſome few circumſtances of New Ordinances; yet, the Ordinances then were but few, and ſuitable to that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, of the Covenant of Grace then made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family; Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion then being one of the ordinary Seals of that Covenant in a Church-way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed; and the Paſſeover the other. For, it's uſeful for us to obſerve that Circumciſion began not with the Ceremonial Law at <hi>Sinai</hi> but was long before a Sign and Seal to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Church in his Family: (which was more correſpondent to a New-Teſtament Church in Goſpel-times, than the national Church of the Jews was.) And hence ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> gave unto you Circumciſion, not becauſe it is of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of the Fathers; <hi>John</hi> 7.22. that is, of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that were long before <hi>Moſes.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this, Circumciſion, we ſee, was both a Seal to Children under the Law; and a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, Externally and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42315:77"/>Eccleſiaſtically diſpenſed, beginning in the Church in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, and continued all along in the Church of the Jews, until Chriſt put an End unto it, by his death.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt ſlipt-over that Expreſſion of yours, <hi>pag.</hi> 218. That nothing is a Seal of the New-Teſtament, but the Holy Spirit. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. and 4.30.] I confeſs, it's a ſtrange Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox to me. Is Believers Baptiſm no Seal with you? Nor the Lord's Supper no Seal? Alas! poor Believers! How have you been deluded? Have you ſo often come to have the pardon of your ſins ſealed, and God's love in Chriſt fealed unto you in the Lord's Supper and now you are told it is no Seal. Ther's none elſe (if you will believe it) but the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit? I thought it had been an External-Seal appointed by our Lord himſelf? Surely ſuch Aſſertions as theſe are, do tend to deſtroy all outward Ordinances of Chriſt; though I hope, you never intended it.</p>
                  <p>This is like to that of ſome others, there is no word of God but Chriſt; and ſo do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Authority of the Holy Scripture. And like that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. I am of Chriſt and care not for <hi>Paul</hi> nor <hi>Apollos,</hi> nor any Miniſters whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Again; you ſay, neither is Baptiſm more than Circumciſion, called a Seal; it is called a Figure ſay you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21, and a Sign
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42315:77"/>—proper only to Men of underſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And not as Circumciſion, which was a Sign not improper for Infants; becauſe it left a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal impreſſion in their fleſh, to be remembred all their days; but ſo cannot Baptiſm be to any Infants, ſay you, <hi>p.</hi> 218— For Anſwer;</p>
                  <p>That Circumciſion was a Seal, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Infants, hath been proved; and your ſelf have acknowledged it, to be a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> though you deny it to be ſo, to all others.</p>
                  <p>And though Baptiſm be no more a Seal, than Circumciſion was, yet I hope, you will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be as much a Seal, as that was.</p>
                  <p>The Gracious Lord hath made a Covenant of Grace; and is willing his people ſhould be confirmed of the Truth of it. And hath he put no Seals to it, to confirm it? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this is a new and ſtrange Doctrine, which the Faithful knew not in former Ages.</p>
                  <p>You ſay Baptiſm is called a Figure, and a Sign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. I Anſwer; The Apoſtle there ſpeaking of the Souls ſaved by water, in Noah's Ark, tells us, that <hi>Baptiſm was a Figure</hi> or Type (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) like to that Type. <hi>Cui nunc reſpondens, exemplar vel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Baptiſmi,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza.</hi> The Ark born up by the Water, wherein <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family were; was firſt a Phyſical and Inſtrumental-cauſe and means of their Temporal preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42315:78"/>of the ſaving of their lives. Secondly, God appointed it to be a Type and Sacrament to them to ſignify and Seal Eternal Salvation, to them through Believing in Chriſt; without whom no Salvation is to be had. Now, ſaith the Apoſtle, Baptiſm is a Type Anſwering that Type; ſignifying and ſealing External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Salvation to all thoſe, and only thoſe, that are, or ſhall be, in Chriſt by Faith.</p>
                  <p>But, ſay you, it is a Sign and Figure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to Men of Underſtanding, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spiritual things, and not as Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer, firſt, The want of the Uſe of Reaſon and Underſtanding, in an Infant, is no Eſſential Defect, or Impediment, as to the External Suſception of Baptiſm; no more than it was heretofore of Circumciſion; which was a Seal of God's Covenant (as hath been proved) and ſignified the ſame things (as to the main, and ſubſtance of them), that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm now doth. By your Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, no Infant ſhould ever have been Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. 2. The God of Grace, in the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal adminiſtration of the Covenant of Grace, to the Infants of Inchurched-Parents, is before hand with them. <hi>I will be the God, of thy Seed Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>and will Circumciſe the heart of thy Seed, Deut.</hi> 30.6. &amp; put's his Seal to it, for their aſſurance, and encouragement to ſeek God for Converting-Grace. And they are to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42315:78"/>in it when they come to underſtanding. 3. Hence, the Infants of Inchurched-Parents are engaged to the Lord; and Circumciſion of old, and Baptiſm now, doth Seal that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; and is of uſe to Children, when come to Underſtanding, to mind them of their Duty. We are Children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that God made with our Fathers, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. And Sealed it unto us in our Infancy; and ſhall we turn our backs upon God? far be it from us. 4. Circumciſion of old, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Infants now, is for the uſe of the Parents as well as the Children, and they are ſuppoſed to have the uſe of Reaſon. You grant, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> Circumciſion was to aſſure him of the Promiſes made to him, and his Seed, <hi>p.</hi> 217. It ſeems then, that Godly Parents have need of ſomething to help their Faith, concerning their Seed, their poor Children; and the Initiatory Seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to their Child is ſuch a help to them. Beſides, the Church have an uſe of it, as hath been ſhewn before; and they are ſuppoſed to underſtand. 5. The preſent ability to make uſe of Baptiſm, is not the Ground upon which it is to be diſpenſed to an Infant; but the Gracious Covenant of God, under which the Infant of an Inchurched-Parent, External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Viſibly is: together wiih his command in the like caſe of old; which as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42315:79"/>was never yet reverſed.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, Baptiſm, is not as Circumciſion which was a Sign, not improper for Infants; and you add the reaſon, to wit, becauſe it left a Signal impreſſion in their fleſh, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred all their days; but ſo cannot Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (ſay you) be to any Infants.</p>
                  <p>And why (I pray) is not Baptiſm, alſo, a Sign not improper, yea, very proper, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? It ſeems it is, becauſe it leaves no ſignal impreſſion in their fleſh, to be remembred all their days. I ſhall examine your reaſon, and then you will ſee the weakneſs of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How could circumciſed-Infants tell when they came to Age whether they were not born, without a <hi>praeputium,</hi> or foreskin. Experience ſhew's, that there are often very ſtrange defects and obliquities in Generation. Some are born Eunuchs, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if it were cut off when they were Infants, how could they tell by what means: Some Children, (as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> that famous Chymiſt and Phyſician) have had their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or ſome part of them, bitten off by a Swine, or ſome other Creature. And what could aſſure them, that they were not ſo?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Suppoſe it were cut off by Men; yet how could they tell, that it was done, in way of an Ordinance of God? They could have no aſſurance of all, or of any, of theſe things
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42315:79"/>but from humane Teſtimony only (unleſs you will ſay, They had it from Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for which you have no ground). Hence then, an Infant Baptized in Infancy, hath as good ground of aſſurance, from a humane Teſtimony, and may as well remember all his days, that he was Baptized, though he hath no ſignal-impreſſion in his fleſh, as an Infant-Circumciſed might have, that had that ſignal-Impreſſion in his fleſh, that he was Circumciſed in his Infancy. The one hath a humane Teſtimony or Tradition to aſſure him, and the other in concluſion, hath no more; which is ſufficient in this, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a matter of fact.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Even an Adult-perſon when he is dipped, hath no more than a humane Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he was Baptized; for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear the words of the Baptizer, when he is under the water. Yet he takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was Baptized into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, and remembers it all his days. By theſe, I hope, you will ſee the weakneſs of your Reaſon. And ſo I come to your fift Queſtion and Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 5. Whether Circumciſion was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to Believers, as Believers, and to their Seed only? <hi>p.</hi> 205. which you alter <hi>p.</hi> 218. and ſay, to their Seed after them, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42315:80"/>add; as ſuch to which Baptiſm was to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond. Your Anſwer is, By no means. And your Reaſon is, becauſe Circumciſion was an Ordinance, which by the Inſtitution, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the natural Lineage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> good or bad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Reply;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Circumciſion was by God's appointment adminiſtred to thoſe Males, that were of the Church in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, and afterwards; that were of the Church of the Jews, and ſo continued, and to their Male Children alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. And Baptiſm now in theſe Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, is by the appointment of the ſame Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, to be adminiſtred to ſuch perſons as are of a Goſpel-Church, and ſo continue, and to their Infants alſo. <hi>Go ye and Diſciple all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c. Matth.</hi> 28.19. As Children of Inchurched-Parents were Diſcipled into the Church of the Jews, and were Circumciſed; ſo now Children among all Nations, that are Diſcipled, by means of their Diſcipled-Parents, ſhould be Baptized, by Chriſt's Commiſſion, as hath been proved. And were not thoſe Inchurched-Parents, to Believe in Chriſt to come; as now Inchurched Parents are to Believe in Chriſt already come? Was not their attendance upon the Sacrifices, and Ceremonial-Worſhip, a profeſſion of their Faith in Chriſt to come; at leaſt in the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42315:80"/>judgment of Charity? What if many of them did not ſavingly Believe? Is it not ſo now alſo? Are all, that are Baptized in your way, true Believers? do all of them Believe with all their heart? I Believe you dare not ſay ſo.</p>
                  <p>You grant, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Believing-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and a Father to them all, but you ſay, He was a publick Common-Father, which reacheth not the Caſe in hand. To which I Reply, <hi>Abraham</hi> may be conſidered in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold capacity. 1. As an Inchurched-Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the natural Father of Children. 2. As the Father of the Faithful then and alſo in all after-Ages, and as Heir of the World. In this latter ſence, no Believer ever was, or ſhall be ſuch a Father as <hi>Abraham</hi> was. But in the former ſence, Every Inchurched Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that hath an Infant, or Infants, is to be ſuch a Father as <hi>Abraham</hi> was. <hi>Abraham</hi> as an Inchurched-Believer, was ſuch a Father to his natural Children as by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, did Externally intereſs his natural Children in God's Covenant, and the Viſible Initiatory-Seal thereof. I will be thy God firſt, and then the God of thy Seed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Circumciſe them. And this Priviledge the Children of Inchurched-Parents have now under the Goſpel.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:42315:81"/>
                  <p> But you ſay, if that were granted, that Priviledge would not ſtand the natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> in any ſtead, to admit them to Baptiſm, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7, 9. <hi>John</hi> rejects them, calling them <hi>a Generation of Vipers,</hi> who ſaid, they <hi>had Abraham for their Father.</hi> For Anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Theſe were not Infants, to whom <hi>John</hi> ſpake but groſs notorious Hypocrites, who carried their Hypocriſie in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, ſo as that <hi>John</hi> could perceive it? and continued obſtinate and Impenitent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance now newly-inſtituted, and belonged to the New-Teſtament-Diſpenſation, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thoſe Phariſees being Adult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons, and notoriouſly corrupt, ſtanding in oppoſition to Chriſt and to the purity of the Goſpel, and power of Godlineſs; there was good Reaſon why <hi>John</hi> ſhould require them to repent, before they were Baptized. For though the Church of the Jews, were then the Church of God (of which thoſe Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were Members) yet it was ſadly corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Suppoſe a Member of a Corrupt-Church ſhould deſire to Communicate with another purer Church; ſhould they not require his Repentance, before they received him? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will eaſily grant it.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:42315:81"/> 3. But what is this to the Infants we are ſpeaking-of? to wit; Infants of Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Parents, who walk regularly in a Goſpel-Church? Here's a vaſt difference between them. More hath been ſaid to this before.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this fifth queſtion with this; That Circumciſion was adminiſtred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents and their Male-Seed (who alone were capable of it); yea, ſuch Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Parents, as made a Viſible-profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt to come; though many of them did not truly Believe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. Whether Baptiſm did ſucceed, in the Room, Place, and Uſe of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Your Anſwer is, by no means, which I ſhall examine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, you ſay, not in the Room and ſtead. And your Reaſons are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe then, only Males, not Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males would be Baptized. This Reaſon I conceive, will not hold; becauſe it ſprings <hi>Ex falſo ſuppoſito,</hi> from a falſhood taken for granted, to wit, That whatever ſucceeds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place of another thing, muſt not be larger than it, in any Circumſtances; which you will ſee to be a great miſtake, if you conſider the Enlargement of Grace, now in theſe Goſpel-days; in which, if the Lord hath by changing his Ordinances, given us thoſe that are more large and extenſive, how
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42315:82"/>ſhould we praiſe his Grace, and not pick quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with it?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe then ſay you, ſome, not all Believers ſhould be Baptized; for all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer, it follow's not. But rather the Grace of God is the more to be admired, now in thoſe Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, for enlarging the extent of theſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that his Goodneſs hath given in ſtead of thoſe that were narrower.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe, ſay you, then, the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, needed not, to have been Baptized, if they had been already Sealed with the New-Covenant-Seal. Neither will this Reaſon hold; for, 1. If God appoint, whether Men need it or no, it is their duty to ſubmit to what he appoints. Hence, ſaith Chriſt, when <hi>John</hi> ſtuck at Baptizing him; <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs,</hi> Math. 3.15. that Reaſon ſatisfied <hi>John.</hi> And it be it be to fulfil Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in obeying any command of God, it ſhould ſatisfie us alſo. But—2. The New-Covenant falling now under a New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſpenſation, by God's appointment, and a New-Seal being added to it, it could not but be of great Uſe to the people of God, Circumciſed before, who were ſtill imperfect and needed to have their Faith ſtrengthened.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42315:82"/>
                  <p> So much to your Reaſons, why you judge Baptiſm did not ſucceed in the Room, and Place of Circumciſion. And now, let me give you my Reaſon, why I judg it did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it in the Room and Place of it; out of <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were not only Believers in Chriſt, but Believers in Church-Order, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.5. Hence the Apoſtle exhorts them, <hi>as they had received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo, they would walk in him;</hi> to wit, both in Believing more in him, and in their Church-Order alſo. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Rooted and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed and abounding therein. v.</hi> 7. Then he gives them a Caveat, to take heed of thoſe Perſons and things that might hinder them, and lead them away from Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and then gives them a Reaſon <hi>v.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodilly;</hi> which he am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth by an Argument in reference to them, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>And ye are compleat in him, which is the head of all principality and Power.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> 
                     <hi>Compleat in him</hi>] not only in Reſpect of all ſaving-Benefits, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Graces; But alſo, in reſpect of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>But they might object; we want Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, which the Jews had. Why, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Ye are alſo Circumciſed</hi> in him,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42315:83"/>with the Circumciſion of Chriſt: which he expounds, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Buried with him by Baptiſm.</hi> Baptiſm there, I conceive, is called the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt; even as Chriſt in the Lord's Supper, is called our Paſſeover, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. which plainly ſhew's, that both the Lord's Supper ſucceeds in the Room and place of the Paſſeover; and Baptiſm in the Room and place of Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you come to ſhew, that Baptiſm did not ſucceed Circumciſion, as to the Ends and Uſes of it. Your Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Circumciſion was a ſign of Chriſt to come in the fleſh; and Baptiſm, that he was already come in the fleſh.] To which I Anſwer, that the End and Uſe of both of them, by your own Confeſſion, reſpected Chriſt; So that they differed not in the main ſubſtantials; but in ſome circumſtances only. They differed not in their End and Uſe as to the Eſſence of the thing, but in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of Time only; the one pointing at Chriſt to come; the other to him already come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Circumciſion, ſay you, was to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-Wall, betwixt Jew and Gentile; but Baptiſm teſtified the contrary, to wit; that Barbarian, Scythian, Bond and Free, Jew and Gentile — were all on in Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42315:83"/>
                  <p> To which I reply; 1. That Circumciſion was not that Partition-Wall, but the whole Ceremonial Law, and Legal-worſhip; as <hi>Beza</hi> well expounds it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. Circumciſion was long before the Ceremonial Law, given to <hi>Abraham;</hi> as we intimated before, <hi>John</hi> 7.22. And was one of the two ordinary and ſtanding-Seals of the Covenant, Externally and Eccleſiaſtically diſpenſed, at firſt, to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the Church in his Family; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed thoſe of the Church, then and afterwards, from all others whatſoever. Even as alſo Baptiſm now doth; or ſhould do at leaſt, Legitimately diſpenſed. It's true, that while Circumciſion laſted as God's Ordinance it ſignified, that Chriſt had not yet broken down that Partition-Wall between Jew and Gentile, and ſo the difference ſtill remained: the Commiſſion as yet, was not given, to <hi>go forth into all the World, and Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every Creature;</hi> but his Words, Statutes and Judgments, formerly given, ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and no other Nation yet had them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. The Gentiles were yet <hi>afar off, Strangers from the Covenants of Promiſe, Eph.</hi> 2.12. which priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed alone to the Church of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5.—<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. So that this doth not reach your purpoſe, nor prove, that Circumciſion was the Partition-Wall. 2. You
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:42315:84"/>ſay, Baptiſm teſtified the Contrary. I Anſwer —Firſt, if your oppoſition had been Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical and Legitimate; you ſhould have ſaid; Circumciſion teſtified that there was a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Wall betwixt Jew and Gentile: but Baptiſm teſtified the contrary. But there's no oppoſition, as you frame it, <hi>Oppoſita enim eidem attribuuntur ſecundum idem, ad idem, &amp;c.</hi> And if you had made the oppoſition aright, it would not have been againſt us at all. For I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Circumciſion, whiles it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Gods Ordinance, did teſtifie; that the partition-Wall ſtill ſtood between Jew and Gentile; and Baptiſm after the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, teſtified that it was broken down; but not ſo, when it was firſt inſtituted, and Adminiſtred by <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, nor by Chriſts Apoſtles before his Death. For, the Partition-Wall ſtood then, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.5, 6. They might not go into the way of the Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, But how do you prove, that Baptiſm teſtified, that <hi>Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> Jew and Gentile were all one in Chriſt?] Baptiſm indeed after the death of Chriſt was a Seal of the New-Covenant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New-Teſtament-Diſpenſation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the God of Grace extended it not only to the Jews, but the Gentiles alſo; giving a free offer of it to the unconverted-Gentiles, to bring them in; and an aſſurance of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42315:84"/>of the bleſſings of the Covenant, to thoſe that were brought in; as well as to the Jews. But this is accidental to Baptiſm, to ſignifie or teſtifie that they were all one in Chriſt; it was Chriſts Commiſſion enlarged, to which, Baptiſm was annexed, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and immediately teſtified, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Jew and Gentile, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. And by this Diſpenſation of the Covenant they were all one in Chriſt, though Baptiſm had never been annexed to it.</p>
                  <p>—Thirdly, But ſuppoſe it were as you aſſert; muſt not Baptiſm ſucceed into the place of Circumciſion, becauſe it hath more Ends and Uſes, than Circumciſion had? Or becauſe it hath ſome Ends and Uſes, that Circumciſion had not? Will you deny the Soveraign Lord God the Liberty to enlarge his Grace in theſe Goſpel-days? Both Circumciſion and Baptiſm are Seals of God's Covenant, and each of them ſuitable to that manner of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, unto which <hi>they are appropriated.</hi> Your reaſoning therefore is, <hi>ex falſo ſuppoſito,</hi> to wit, That, that cannot ſucceed into the Room and Place, of another thing, whoſe Ends and Uſes differ in ſome circumſtances; though for the main ſubſtance, they ſignifie the ſame. When you have proved it ſolidly, you may expect it may be Embraced, and not before. This general Anſwer, will
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42315:85"/>reach the reſt of your Ends and Uſes, wherein you ſay they differ. Now to the third.</p>
                  <p>This is, as if one ſhould ſay, the <hi>Ammonites</hi> did not ſucceed the <hi>Zanzummims,</hi> and dwell in their ſtead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not Gyants as they were: Contrary to <hi>Deur.</hi> 2.20, 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Circumciſion, ſay you, Initiated the Carnal Seed into the Carnal Church, and gave them right to the Carnal Ordinances; but Baptiſm was to give the Spiritual Seed an orderly entrance into the Spiritual-Church, and a right to partake of ſpiritual-Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.] To which I Anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were initiated Externally by the Covenant into the Church, before they were Circumciſed; and thereby they had a right to Circumciſion, (as hath been proved before) which was the Sign &amp; Seal of their Initiation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſeems to be a carnal Expreſſion, to call the Church in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, a carnal Church. The Church of the Jews indeed, when they became National, had a <hi>worldly Sanctuary, Heb.</hi> 9.1. <hi>and carnal Ordinances, v,</hi> 10. but that it was a Carnal Church, is an Expreſſion that I find not in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and I dare not call it ſo. By <hi>Worldly Sanctuary</hi>] he means the Tabernacle, and all the External glory of the Levitical Service, only as it was the Earthly-Repreſentation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42315:85"/>things, by which Earthly ſhadows they were by Faith to look at Heavenly things which were the ſubſtance. And <hi>Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances];</hi> Either becauſe the Levitical Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were ſevered from the things they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as the Carnal Jews took them, and reſted in them: Or; becauſe carnal things were uſed in thoſe Ordinances to repreſent Spiritual. But as they were joyned with their ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo,
<note place="margin">See Mr. Dick. ſon, on <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.</note> there were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Atonement made, and annexed to them, which True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers did enjoy. If it were a Carnal Church, and no Spirituality in it, how then could any be ſaved in it? The faithful then, no doubt, did look at Chriſt, in thoſe Carnal Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to wit, the Bulls and Goats and other things that were offered in Sacrifice; and Chriſts Spirit was among them, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Baptiſm was not to give the Spiritual Seed an orderly entrance into the Spiritual Church; as hath been proved before; but was to ſignifie and Seal the Entrance they had by God's Covenant, before they were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; even as Circumciſion was, by your own Confeſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 223.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You do not here plainly tell us, who thoſe Spiritual Seed are; but by the Current
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42315:86"/>of your diſcourſe, it appear's you mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly True Believers in Chriſt; and then, what makes an Hypocrite in any of your Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations? Why was he Baptized?</p>
                  <p n="5">5, Nor do you here tell us, what you mean by Spiritual Church, and Spiritual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. I conceive you mean, a viſible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Church, and Goſpel-Ordinances; which if oppoſed to Carnal-Ordinances; <hi>muſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the plain, and ſimple Ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, repreſenting Chriſt as in a Looking-Glaſs,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> and not under the Veil of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, where the Blood of Bulls, and Goats, and other Carnal things, were uſed by God's appointment, to ſignifie and ſet forth Chriſt unto them.—</p>
                  <p>Let us now gather up the ſum of your Argument.</p>
                  <p>If Circumciſion Initiated the Carnal Seed into the Carnal Church, and gave them right to the Carnal-Ordinances; But Baptiſm, the Spiritual Seed into the Spiritual Church, and gave them a right to Spiritual Ordinances; then the End and Uſe of both, is not the ſame and ſo, Baptiſm doth not ſucceed into the Room of Circumciſion. <hi>At;—Ergo</hi> — Beſides the flaws in the Antecedent, I deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the Propoſition; For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By your own arguing, the End and Uſe of Both, is to enter them (as you ſay)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42315:86"/>into the Church: and the Church in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Family where Circumciſion began, was the Church of God, a Spiritual and not a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church (as you term it) and their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances then were few, and fit to repreſent Spiritual things unto them; ſuitable to that time. And as for Circumciſion, it was not one of thoſe Legal Ceremonies, but a Seal annexed to God's Covenant, in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, long before the Ceremonial Law, conſiſting of Carnal Ordinances, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Yea afterwards, when the Ceremonial Law was brought in (whoſe Ordinances in ſome ſence are called Carnal; yet it appears they had a Spiritual ſignification, &amp; led to Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24 &amp; therefore in a right ſence, Spiritual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as to their ſignification and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.—</p>
                  <p>Hence, the End and Uſe of both, as to the main ſubſtance, is the ſame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Baptiſm may well ſucceed into the Room of Circumciſion, by your own Argument. And ſo I come to your fourth Uſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Circumciſion, ſay you, was to be a Bond and Obligation, to keep the whole Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but Baptiſm witneſſed, that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was made void, and that only Chriſt's Law was to be kept, I Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Your Aſſertion is doubtful for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42315:87"/>your ſelf. Your words ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. when Circumciſion was aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, and no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God; the Apoſtle tells them then, that if they were Circumciſed, <hi>Chriſt would profit them nothing;</hi> for it would be as if they had ſaid, and held, that Chriſt had not died and ſatisfied for ſin; and ſo, ſuch a one <hi>would be a debtor to do the whole Law;</hi> Circumciſion being one of the Ordinary Seals of God's Covenant, under that Legal Diſpenſation, until Chriſt ſhould come to fulfil the Law, would now, by their abuſe, and perverting of it, engage them to perform perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the whole Law in their own perſons; under penalty of Eternal damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſpeaks to ſuch, as it ſeems, would joyn their own performances, and legal Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that this doth not reach your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for you ſpeak of Circumciſion as it was a bleſſed Ordinance of God in force, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep the whole Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in an Evangelical manner, looking to Chriſt alone for Righteouſneſs to juſtifie them; and the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, as now aboliſhed by Chriſt, and perverted by ſome of theſe <hi>Galatians,</hi> who would make a mixture of their own perſonal Righteouſneſs, the Legal Ceremonies and Chriſt's Righteouſneſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42315:87"/>in the buſineſs of their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt of the phraſes, had you told us, what you mean by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and what by the Law of Chriſt? We ſhould then have been able to judge of your Argument; but now it muſt remain with your ſelf. If in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, you include the Moral-Law, I muſt aſſert, that, that alſo is the Law of Chriſt, and brought under Chriſt, for Goſpel-Ends, which I ſuppoſe, you will not deny. Thus much to the fourth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Circumciſion, ſay you, was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to all <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed, without any profeſſion of Faith, Repentance, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; whereas Baptiſm—to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seed was only upon profeſſion of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which more fully appears by three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For Anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was by God's command to be done upon Infants of Inchurched-Parents, who were not capable then of making any ſuch profeſſion, and we know no abſurdity, that Baptiſm ſhould now be adminiſtred to Infants of Inchurched-Parents, though they can make no ſuch profeſſion of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Circumciſion was adminiſtred not only to all <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed, but to his Church-Seed; to wit, Proſelites and their Male-Children; and the Children of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42315:88"/>his Servants who were themſelves Circumciſed,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48.</note> when <hi>Abraham was, Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for Adult-Perſons to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, why was not the ſame, or like profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith and Repentance required of them, as of <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf? God requires of him, the Fruits and effects of both, and that before he was circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I am God Almighty, walk before me and be upright.</hi> And how could he do ſo, either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly to men, or Viſibly, without Believing and Regeneration, ſuitable to thoſe? Your ſelf grant, that <hi>Abraham</hi> received the ſign of Circumciſion, the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith, which he had before. And it is an impregnable Truth, that Circumciſion did mediately ſignifie and Seal Regeneration, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4 with <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. and Heart-Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; as your ſelf have granted <hi>p.</hi> 223.</p>
                  <p>How therefore can you prove, that thoſe of years, that were to be Circumciſed, were to make no profeſſion of Faith and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? It's probable, that it was not, indeed, ſo manifeſt and expreſs, as what is required now in Goſpel-times; but that there was not any at all, ſuitable to the Church under that. Diſpenſation, is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and without proof. Did Proſelytes make no kind of profeſſion of Faith, before Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion?
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42315:88"/>How then could the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> know, what difference there was between them, and their Heathen Neighbours? Did they no more, but offer themſelves to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed only? And did the Church admit them upon that offer, without any further tranſaction? certainly, that would have been the way to make bad Church-work. When you give better proof, we ſhall either Embrace, or elſe Anſwer your Argument. I now come to examine your three Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, what you mean by a Spiritual-parent I cannot underſtand; only I gueſs, you mean the Holy Ghoſt; and then, that Inſtance (as to the ſubſtance of it) hath been Anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. An Inchurched Parent, both then, and now, gives right to the Initiatory Seal to the Child.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe ſay you, a Legal,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 222.</note> Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Typical Holineſs (when Land—Houſes—and Trees were holy) qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Circumciſion; whereas only Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, and perſonal Holineſs, was a meet qualification for Baptiſm. I Anſwer,</p>
                  <p>As Eccleſiaſtical and Federal Holineſs qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Circumciſion of old, ſo Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Federal Holineſs doth now for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, (as hath been proved). What you mean by Typical Holineſs here, and of what
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42315:89"/>was Typical, I underſtand not, becauſe you have not here declared it, But you ſeem to make the Holineſs of Children then, the ſame with Land and Trees. Was the federal Holineſs of Children then, the ſame with that of Land and Trees?</p>
                  <p>If there be not now an Evangelical-Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical-Holineſs, what Holineſs is that, which a Hypocrite hath, whom you Baptize? A legal-Eccleſiaſtical Holineſs, it is not; for that, ſay you is paſt and gone; Typical Holineſs it is not; for that, be it what you pleaſe to call it, is alſo vaniſhed. Real Spiritual-Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs it is not; for he is an Hypocrite. What then will you call it? If it be not an Evangelical-Eccleſiaſtical, and Federal Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is none at all; and why then is he Baptized?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſay you, becauſe ſtrangers, and Servants bought with mony, and all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Children of eight days old; yea Trees, were capable of Circumciſion; whereas only Men of underſtanding capable to Believe with all their heart, and give an account with their mouths, were to be eſteemed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable ſubjects of Baptiſm. I Anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Were not thoſe ſtrangers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants bought with mony, Men capable of underſtanding?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:42315:89"/> 2. Were they not inſtructed by <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> before they were Circumciſed? <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was a long time a Believer, before God put him and his Family into that Church-Eſtate, and commanded them to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; as you will eaſily grant. And God ſpeaks of him as one that had experience, of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Care, Induſtry and Faithfulneſs, that way, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. And how do you know, that God gave not a Bleſſing to his Endeavours, at leaſt ſo far, as that they outwardly made ſome profeſſion of Faith and Regeneration, ſuitable to the State of the Church in thoſe days? Is it probable or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to think, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ran upon the Men of his Family, as upon a Company of Bruit Beaſts, to Circumciſe them, without inſtructing them, what the mind of God was in it? Surely, that had been to deal with Beaſts and not with Men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Children of inchurched-Parents, of eight days old, were capable of Circumciſion then; and ſo they are of Baptiſm now; though they cannot give an account with their mouths, which I hold their Parents ought to do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But that Trees alſo were capable of Circumciſion, I ſuppoſe, you will not be able to prove. If you diligently examine the Text, and conſult judicious Commentators upon it,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42315:90"/>you will find no ſuch ſence as you and ſome others put upon it.

Secondly, It ſignifies to take away the foreskin; or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion of any thing; and then it is as much as if he ſaid; Ye ſhall ſhake down the fruits of it, as unclean.—Or as the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, by removing, ye ſhall remove the fruits thereof; that is, ye ſhall caſt them away as unclean. For the firſt three years, they might
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42315:90"/>not eat any of the Fruits, not put them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profitable Uſe, nor ſell them to Infidels; and if any did eat, but ſo much as an Olive, he was to be beaten by the Law, ſaith <hi>Ainſw.</hi> out of <hi>Maimony,</hi> upon that Scripture.</p>
                  <p>It's plain hence, that the Uncircumciſion and Circumciſion here, was in reference to the impurity of the Fruits of the Trees, and not to the cutting, or gaſhing of the Tree: the Fruits were to be unclean, and as uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed unto them.</p>
                  <p>It will be time now, to gather up your Argument, that we may ſee the Validity of it.</p>
                  <p>If Strangers, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all ignorant Children of eight days old; yea and Trees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were capable of Circumciſion; then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was adminiſtred to all <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed without any profeſſion of Faith, Repentance and Regeneration. <hi>At—Ergo.</hi>— Let reaſonable Men judge of the inconſequence of this Propoſition, having before read, what I have Anſwered to the particulars in it. I now come to your ſixth proof.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Circumciſion was to be a Sign of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings and Benefits, to be enjoyed in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> whereas Baptiſm was to be a Sign of many Spiritual Benefits, <hi>viz. Remiſſion of ſins, Juſtification, Sanctification</hi>— and <hi>Eternal Salvation.</hi>] To which I reply;</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:42315:91"/> 1. And why was it not a Seal, rather than a Sign; or at leaſt, as well as a Sign, to aſſure them of the Promiſe of that Land unto them? was it not a Seal of God's Covenant to them (as hath been ſhewed before?) And is not Baptiſm now the like? Doth it not Seal outward Temporal Bleſſings and Benefits promiſed though implicitly in the Covenant, as well as Circumciſion did?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And was Circumciſion a Sign and a Seal only of <hi>Canaan</hi> unto them? You by and by after grant, that there are in ſome things an Analogy betwixt Circumciſion and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to wit; both of them ſignifying Heart-Circumciſion, and an Initiating into the Church, <hi>p.</hi> 223. And why did you not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them alſo, when you ſaid, Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was to be a Sign of Temporal Bleſſings and Benefits, to be enjoyed in the Land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> As if it had ſignified only thoſe Temporal Benefits to them? This Seem's not fair dealing, but rather an impoſing upon your inadvertent Reader. And had you fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted this ſooner, it would have ſpared you a great deal of needleſs Labour. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion then, by your own grant, ſignifies Heart-Circumciſion and Initiating into the (Viſible) Church, even as Baptiſm alſo doth, which is that we plead for. And if it did ſignifie ſo; then both the Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren-Circumciſed,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42315:91"/>had an advantage hereby, to ſeek unto God, to Circumciſe their hearts who had ſignified and Sealed it to them in that Holy Ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Circumciſion ſignified Heart-Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, to thoſe that were Circumciſed, then it muſt alſo ſignifie Remiſſion of ſins, and Juſtification by the Blood of Chriſt; and Sanctification alſo; and conſequently Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation following thoſe Benefits, which they were in that Order to look after, of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type unto them. And then, what ſubſtantial difference, is there between Baptiſm and Circumciſion? This were to Seek a knot in a Bulruſh, as the Proverb is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To wave the force of your own grant you tell us, though it were a Sign of Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into the Church, yet it was a different-Church, different Subjects, and Church-Members, upon different Grounds, and to different Ends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I return; what if it were a different Church in ſome Circumſtances? Was it not a Church of God? a Church of God's inſtituting and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Did it not conſiſt of the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterwards continued unto his Poſterity; into which the Chriſtian Gentiles were ingrafted, and into
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42315:92"/>which, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall be again ingrafted, in theſe latter days of the Goſpel? ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 23, 24, 26, 27, 31. Were not their Children then, Externally and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically in Covenant, and Members of the Church, as the Children of Inchurched Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and did then partake of the Initiatory Sign and Seal of the Covenant? and ſhall their Children then be left out, when God ſhall again ingraft their Parents in? Weigh the Promiſes made to theſe Goſpel-times, when God ſhall bring them in. <hi>Their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be as afore-time, and their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be eſtabliſhed before me,</hi> Jer. 30.20. with Deut. 29.10, 11. to v. 16. <hi>They are the Seed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring with them,</hi> Iſa. 65.23. <hi>The Children of thy Servants ſhall continue, and their Seed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before thee,</hi> Pſal. 102. laſt. See more, Ezek. 37.25, 26. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and to your Children,</hi> Acts 2.39.</p>
                  <p>The Grounds and Ends alſo, that are of God's appointing, are for the ſubſtance the ſame; (as hath been proved) though in ſome Circumſtances, they may differ; God having enlarged his Grace towards poor wretches, now in theſe Goſpel-days. And that Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and proportion which you your ſelf do grant, in the main ſubſtantial things ſignified by Circumciſion and Baptiſm, together with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42315:92"/>what I have evidenced out of <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. do give us ſufficient ground to conclude, that Baptiſm is come into the room, ſtead, &amp; Uſe of Circumciſion, notwithſtanding all that you have brought to the contrary; which I hope doth appear, by what hath been replyed to you before.</p>
                  <p>And whereas, you ſay, by the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, we may as well conclude, that it cometh in the Room and ſtead of the Ark, Manna, Rock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a grand miſtake; for Circumciſion was one of the two Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacraments and Seals of God's Covenant, given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Church in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, about four hundred years before the Ark, Manna, or that Rock you ſpeak of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. There were many extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacraments, that God appointed to that Nonage-people, or Heirs under Age (to uſe the Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3.) which God in mercy gave, to help their Faith upon ſpecial occaſions, and emergencies, beſides ſome that you mention; to wit, the Brazen-Serpent for one, which was but occaſional, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.14, 15. But Circumciſion was one of the ſtanding Sacraments and Seals annexed to the Covenant under a Church-diſpenſation, all along; into the place of which, Baptiſm by the Lord's-appointment is come; which holds proportion with it, in all the main
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42315:93"/>things it ſignified and Sealed. And hence;</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You will eaſily have an Anſwer, to thoſe Popiſh abſurdities and abominations, you would faſten upon our Tenent. We do not affirm, meerly from the Analogy, that Baptiſm is come in the room of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, if we had not ſomething out of Scripture to warrant it, we durſt not pin it upon a meer Analogy. If therefore Papiſts, or other ſuperſtitious wits, by arguments drawn from Analogies, bring-in Jewiſh Rites as High-Prieſthood, National Churches, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Prieſthood, and other innumerable Rites and Ceremonies, without any Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, or New-Teſtament Authority; we have as good ground left us in Scripture to convince them, as you have, and I hope, ſhould be as ready to do it, as occaſion ſhall be offerred. And thus I have done with your ſixth Queſtion, propounded long before, and your Anſwers to it; &amp; now come to the ſeventh.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 7. Whether the not-Baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, makes the Priviledges under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, leſs than the Circumciſing them under the Law? <hi>p.</hi> 205. which you ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>p.</hi> 228. ſaying, leſs than under the Law, who had then Circumciſion? Your Anſwer is, not at all.] and give your reaſons; why Not-Baptizing of Infants, makes not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-priviledges, leſs than legal. Firſt, they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42315:93"/>were not ſay you, Circumciſed, becauſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers, or ſealed with a New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Seal, as being in the New-Covenant, —but upon the account of a Birth-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as of the natural lineage and Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> as a Typical Shadowy thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —I Reply,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Were not their Parents profeſſing-Believers, at leaſt, under ſuch a profeſſion, as ſuited that Diſpenſation? Did they not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Sacrifices, which pointed their Faith at Chriſt to come? And were not they, as they grew up to come before the Lord, and ſay, <hi>A Syrian ready to periſh was my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5. to <hi>v.</hi> 12. and there they were to <hi>worſhip before the Lord:</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, <hi>v.</hi> 27. to <hi>avouch the Lord to be their God,</hi> as he alſo avouched them to be his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Was there no profeſſion of Faith in all this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Were they not Sealed with the Seal of the Covenant of Grace under an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Eccleſiaſtical Diſpenſation? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you will not ſay, it was the Covenant of Works, though when it became National it was given in ſomewhat a legal manner.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What was that Birth-priviledge? Did it not depend upon the Covenant Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically diſpenſed, and ſubmitted to? <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed; Gen.</hi> 17.7.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42315:94"/>And did it not run in the natural Lineage and Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they were his Church-Seed? (as hath been ſhewn). I pray conſider, what were the Proſelytes and their Children, who were alſo Circumciſed? they were not at all the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but they were his Viſible-Church Seed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You ſay, Circumciſion was to diſtinguiſh them from the Nations, and to keep that line clear, from whence Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh ſhould come. Suppoſe this laſt to be true of <hi>Abraham's</hi> natural Seed, what was this to the Proſelytes, and their Seed, from whom Chriſt was not to come? yet they were to be Circumciſed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You ſay, there is no ſuch thing in the Goſpel, the Body and Subſtance being come, the ſhadow was to vaniſh and paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:—no Birth-priviledge but the new Birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no ſuch thing as Bodily Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in the Goſpel, that is indeed aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is no Birth-priviledge of the Children of Inchurched-Parents under the Goſpel, but the new-Birth, that I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and have already proved, that there is. And that that Birth-priviledge is a means and help, tending to the New-Birth, if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improved. Chriſt is the common Father
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:42315:94"/>of Inchurched-Parents and their Seed, now in theſe Goſpel-days; and they are Externally and Eccleſiaſtically Chriſt's and <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed, and in the ſame ſence, Heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as hath been already proved. And this Priviledge is not a Bondage, and a returning to the Type, and Shadow, (as you term it) but a bleſſed Fruit of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who hath a Church-Seed now, as well as heretofore. What elſe is the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, that you admit, if he be not one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Church-Seed? He is not one of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Seed Spiritually and Savingly, nor hath the New-Birth indeed; yet you judge him to have it Eccleſiaſtically, and hence you Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him. So much to your firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, neither ought ſuch a thing (ſay you) to be any more eſteemed, the loſs of a priviledge, than our not enjoying literally, a Holy-Land, City, Temple, Succeſſion of a High-Prieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The loſs of Baptizing the Infants of Inchurched-Parents under the Goſpel, would be the loſs of a great priviledge both to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children, which under the Law, they did enjoy. For it would be a loſs of that, which ſignified and Sealed God to be their God, and the God of their Seed; and to Circumciſe their hearts to love the Lord, and to ſignifie their initiating into the Church; by
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:42315:95"/>your own conceſſion; and this would be the loſs of no ſmall Priviledge; and therefore, we cannot eaſily bear this loſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the loſs of a Priviledge alſo, in reference to Temporal Bleſſings, and External Ordinances and means of Converſion. As <hi>Canaan</hi> was an External Bleſſing ſignified and Sealed to them by Circumciſion; ſo Temporal Bleſſings are to us, and our Infants by Baptiſm.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.</note> For it is a Sign and Seal of God's Covenant wherein Temporal Bleſſings are alſo implied, and in the Explanation of it by other Scriptures, expreſly promiſed. So alſo for External means of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the loſs of a Priviledge alſo, in reference to Heaven and Eternal Happineſs there, of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type unto them; that if they did truly Believe in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> then to come, and walk in the ways of God, Eternal Salvation was Sealed unto them thereby. All thoſe we muſt loſe, and yet eſteem the loſs of them, the loſs of no Priviledge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is not the like Reaſon of the loſs of Baptiſm, and our not-enjoying a Holy Land, City, Temple and ſucceſſion of a High-Prieſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For, Circumciſion was a Sign and Seal of the Covenant, and ſo were not thoſe things; the high-Prieſt was a Type of Chriſt,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:42315:95"/>and that Type was fulfilled in him; and we need no ſucceſſion therein; as there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Prieſthood; which was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſucceſſively until the Time of Reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. But as for the ſucceſſion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Members of the Church, (I ſay, Infant and Mediate Members) that was long before the High-Prieſthood, in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family, and the Church there; and is not of the ſame nature with the Prieſt-hood. And whereas you make this ſucceſſion Typical, as that of the Prieſt-hood was; I muſt crave leave to tell you, that it is a Type of your own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and not of the Lord's; and a Shadow of your own ſubſtance; and therefore I muſt leave it to follow you. I never yet could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by any thing that I have read and heard, nor have you as yet proved, that the Infant-Memberſhip, and Circumciſion of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren heretofore, was a Type of the Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Baptizing only of Adult-Believers under the Goſpel: and that, that priviledge which Infants of Inchurched-Parents had then by Generation from their natural-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents, was a Type of all Church-Members under the Goſpel, only by Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. When you have ſolidly, and out of the Holy Scripture proved this, I ſhall then conſider of your <hi>Therefore</hi>] towards the latter end of that Paragraph, <hi>p.</hi> 229. But till then
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:42315:96"/>I ſhall conclude, that we ſhould, to uſe your words, be great loſers by the bargain. But perhaps, your third, with the Reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, will prove it. I ſhall therefore fairly examine them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſay you, if it ſhould be granted, that Circumciſion was a Seal of the New-Covenant, belonging to all the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet would not the Baptizing of the Children of Believers anſwer it; nor amount to ſo great a Priviledge, nor be equivalent to it, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Say you, Becauſe all the Families and Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and all Proſelyted-ſtrangers) with their Children, without diſtinction of good or bad, were to be Circumciſed, but now (in the time of the Goſpel) one of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and two of a Tribe; Believers are but thin ſown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, firſt more generally; That the Baptizing of the Children of Inchurched-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers would fitly Anſwer it, and would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to ſo great a priviledge, and be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to it, notwithſtanding your Reaſons. More particularly to your firſt Reaſon; were not all thoſe Families and Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all thoſe proſelyted-ſtrangers, with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, of the Church of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Can you deny that? If they were, (as indeed they were) there was good Reaſon why they ſhould be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:42315:96"/>And ſo we ſay,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</note> of Inchurched-Believers-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, now under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in reference to Baptiſm; as long as their Parent continues in a right eſtate in the Church And this doth moſt fitly, and rationally An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the other, and is in the main ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials equivalent to it. What you ſay, of the Children of wicked Men, if they be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly wicked, they ſhould not be admitted into the Church; and if they afterwards appear to be wicked, (as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did) to continue impenitent, they are to be caſt out of the Church, and ſo to be looked on as Heathens and Publicans, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>2. Say you, <hi>You would be very ſhort in another reſpect,</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>at an utter uncertainty, when you had a right Subject; for the Parent might</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>be a Hypocrite, or no Elect-perſon, which is out of your reach to underſtand; you cannot know whether the Child be fit for Baptiſm; for, the Seed of a wicked Man you muſt not meddle with by any means, whereas there was not the leaſt doubt or ſcruple in</hi> Iſrael <hi>as to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for the Father being Circumciſed, it was an infallible work, they were right.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I greatly ſuſpect, that for all you have written ſo much againſt <hi>Paedo-Baptiſts,</hi> you are yet to ſeek of the right hinge of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:42315:97"/>Controverſy. I would rather ſuſpect it is ſo, than that you do it maliciouſly; hoping, that when you ſee the true ſtate of it, you will not be unwilling to let in the Truth; and to ſee how ſtrongly your grounds of arguing here againſt us, will make againſt the way you plead for, and practice. I here aſſert, that though the Inchurched-Parent ſhould be a Hypocrite not diſcovered, and no Elect-perſon to Eternal Salvation, yet our Principle is; His Child ought to be Baptized, and we know his Child to be fit for Baptiſm. We are not at an uncertainty, much leſs, at an utter uncertainty, when we have a right ſubject; but we are as certain as they could be in the Church of the Jews. They knew the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Father of ſuch a Child, was a Member of the Church of the Jews; and was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and we do as infallibly know, that ſuch a Parent now is a Member of a Goſpel-Church and that he was Baptized. They had thoſe, that knew the one, and we have thoſe that know the other, as infallibly as they could know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be replied, that they could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prove, their Parents were Jews, than we that ours are Believers. I Anſwer;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They could not prove it while they were Infants, any more than our's can, that their Parents are Believers; and yet the Infants
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:42315:97"/>were Circumciſed at eight days old.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There's no neceſſity, that a Child ſhould prove himſelf to be the Child of a Jew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Circumciſed. It was the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Duty, and the Miniſters of it, to look to that; and not the Child's. The like I ſay now of Children to be Baptized.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Infants now when grown up, can as well prove to the ſatisfaction of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (if there be any ſcruple about it) that their Parents were Inchurched-profeſſing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as the others, that their Parents were Jews. They had the Teſtimony of the Church, and Children now have as much. Chriſt commends the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for their care, in diſtinguiſhing between the true Members of the Church, and thoſe of the <hi>Synagogue of Satan,</hi> Rev. 3.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But ſuppoſe the Mother did ſecretly play the Harlot with a Gentile, could the Child when grown prove his Father to be a Jew? He could no better prove it, than we, that ours were Believers: Unleſs you will ſay, that wives now-a-days, that have Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to their Husbands, are more to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſecret uncleanneſs and unfaithfulneſs, than the Wives of the Jews were. The Mother can beſt aſſure the Child in this Caſe, if the Churches teſtimony will not ſuffice him.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:42315:98"/> 2. My Second Anſwer to your ſecond Reaſon, will return the force of your Reaſon againſt your ſelf. I ſhall peremptorily aſſert, that this abſurdity which you would faſten upon us, and our Tenent, doth ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon your ſelf and yours. We know our Subject; we hold the Baptiſm of no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, but of Inchurched-Parents one at leaſt, who are of the Viſible-Church: But you are at an utter uncertainty when to meet with a right Subject; for you do not hold an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite to be in the Covenant of Grace at all. Spiritually and Savingly he is not in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace; for he is an Hypocrite: Externally and Eccleſiaſtically he is not (as you hold) for you will not own an External, and Eccleſiaſtical Diſpenſation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, now in the days of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Yet, Baptize him you do, upon this conjecture, that he is a true-Believer; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he appears to be otherwiſe. Now I beſeech you, deal ingenuouſly, and ſee, who is at an utter uncertainty, when to have a right Subject of Baptiſm, if you be not? But as for our Subject we know where to find him. We can know whether he be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally and Eccleſiaſtically within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or no; but cannot ſay infallibly he is a a true Believer, or Elect unto Salvation, which is out of our reach to underſtand; and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:42315:98"/>ſhall leave it to thoſe that are reſolved to go upon ſuch uncertain Grounds. So much to your ſecond Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You ſay, neither can the Child, (when grown up) have any certain knowledg that ſuch a Ceremony (<hi>viz.</hi> as Baptiſm) hath paſt upon him in Infancy; he having no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible mark thereof, as the Circumciſed-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant had.]—This hath been punctually an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to before. I ſhall therefore conclude, againſt all your Demonſtrations, (as you call them) that Inchurched-Parents would loſe a great and ineſtimable Priviledge under the Goſpel, if their Infants were not External<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Eccleſiaſtically intereſſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and in Baptiſm the Seal of it; and ſo would the Infants too: and in this reſpect, their Priviledges under the Goſpel, would be leſs, than theirs under the Law.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add further, to what hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Miniſtry is not ſucceſſive, as theirs of old was, to the firſt-born, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Family of <hi>Levi,</hi> and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, of <hi>Aaron.</hi> We own no ſuch thing in owning the Birth-Priviledge of Infants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Goſpel-Church-Eſtate, in reference to Adult and Immediate Members, is not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42315:99"/> 1. It's requiſit, that ſuch perſons ſhould make a perſonal credible profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, and lay hold of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant themſelves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4, 5, 6. as the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch which might be the Child of a Jew muſt do now in theſe Goſpel-times.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's apparent, that many Children of Inchurched-Parents, who in their Infancy were Mediate-Members, do never, when grown, make ſuch a profeſſion, and lay hold of the Covenant themſelves, and ſo, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver become regularly Immediate Members; but ſome do draw back, and of ſuch, God hath ſaid, <hi>His Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in them,</hi> Heb. 10.38. And thus, in reſpect of Adult-Children of Inchurched-Parents, the Church now is not ſucceſſive:—But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Goſpel-Church-Eſtate, in reference to the Infants of Inchurched-Parents is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, as it was in the Church in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and afterwards among the Jews, as to the ſubſtance of it. The Infants of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Parents were then Mediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed,</hi> Gen. 17.7. And ſo they are now in theſe Goſpel-days. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and your Children,</hi> Acts 2.39.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence it will clearly follow, that the Church under the Goſpel, would be leſs pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged and blſſed, than that in the Family
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42315:99"/>of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterwards among the Jews, if it were not thus ſucceſſive in reference to the Children of Inchurched-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. For both Parents in reference to their Children, and Children in reſpect of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, would be deprived of a Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Bleſſing, which both Parents, and Children of old, did enjoy. Which is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable and contrary to the Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is enlarged and not ſtraitned; and contrary to the whole current of Goſpel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, to Inchurched-Parents and their Children. For, Inchurched-Believers could not in the due latitude and extent of it, be Heirs according to the Promiſe (as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. If their Children ſhould be Externally exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Promiſe. For, the Childrens-right to the Promiſe in it's External and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſpenſation, is a part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Inheritance; <hi>I will be</hi> (firſt) <hi>thy God; and</hi> (then) <hi>the God of thy Seed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is worth our notice; that thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Goſpel-Promiſes concerning the Seed and Children, do run firſt to the Parents; and are made Immediately to them, in reference to their Children. Their Children ſhall be as afore-time; and their Congregation ſhall be eſtabliſhed before me. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.20. <hi>They are the Seed of the bleſſed of the Lord, and their off-ſpring with them,</hi> Iſa. 65.23. <hi>All thy

And hence it muſt needs ſtick with us, and be a <hi>Cordolium</hi> and heart-breaking to us, to loſe ſo great a part of our inheritance from our ſelves and our Children. If Inchurched-Parents ſhould not be a means to convey unto their Infants an External Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace; and a Right to Baptiſm (now the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiatory Seal of it) then ſurely, there muſt be a breach and a Rupture in the Covenant of Grace to God's people, and their Seed; which we can by no means admit of: For we and our Goſpel-Church-Eſtate, and our Children, would exceedingly ſuffer by it; we having loſt a priviledge, which they of old enjoyed, and nothing in the ſtead of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Ceremony of Baptiſm, <hi>ſay you,</hi> is by Dipping, <hi>p.</hi> 232. not by ſprinkling.</p>
               <p>You would prove it firſt by the proper and genuine ſignification of the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42315:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>which End you produce divers Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that <hi>Baptizo</hi> properly ſignifies, to Dip, Plunge, Overwhelm, put Under, Cover-o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to die Colour, which is done by plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet <hi>p.</hi> 248. you grant it ſignifies waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.— But, ſay you, it is ſuch waſhing as is by Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. To which I Anſwer,</p>
               <p>That the Uſe of the Word in Scripture, (which is the authentick expoſitour of it ſelf) gives us ground to interpret it waſhing, by way of Sprinkling or pouring on of Water, and not by Dipping. What the Apoſtle terms <hi>divers Waſhings</hi> or <hi>Baptiſms</hi> (ſo the Greek) <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. he afterwards calls ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; <hi>ſprinkling the unclean,</hi> v. 13. and <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>He ſprinkled both the Book and the People,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>He ſprinkled both the Tabernacle, and the Veſſels of the Miniſtry.</hi> And this is more than all humane Authorities. Add to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. <hi>Our Fathers were all Baptized in the Cloud and in the Sea.</hi> I wonder you ſhould bring this place to prove Dipping. How were they Baptized in the Cloud, but by the bedewings of it? They were aſperſed with the Atoms of the moiſture, that was in it. And how were they Baptized in the Sea? Were they plunged in it, as <hi>Pharach</hi> and his Egyptians were? I cannot think you will ſay ſo. But they were ſprinkled by the Waters
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:42315:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>as they paſſed by. Where (by the way) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſome of thoſe, which the Apoſtle calls Fathers, were then Infants, and young Children, who were Baptized then, as well as grown perſons.</p>
               <p>But to make your Interpretation hold, you tell us <hi>p.</hi> 237. That they were encompaſſed with the Cloud over their head, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Sea on both ſides; and this you make to be a dipping. This is a fallacy <hi>a male con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctis ad bene diviſa.</hi> You joyn both theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that were then at that very time ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, as to the Body of the Camp of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites; for, it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.19. <hi>The Pillar of the Cloud went from before their Face, and ſtood behind them.</hi> Mark the words <hi>behind them,</hi> not over them, as you affirm. And <hi>v.</hi> 20. It came between the Camp of the Egyptians and the Camp of Iſrael. How can you evade this? I cannot but admire the Wiſdom of God, in expreſſing this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Again; That <hi>Baptizing</hi>] ſignifies waſhing; and that, not by dipping ſeems plain, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.4. <hi>The Phariſees</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Market,

                  <hi>Eat not except they waſh;</hi> except they were Baptized or did Baptize themſelves: ſo the Greek. Did they every time dip and plunge themſelves over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:42315:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>head and ears? So <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.38. <hi>The Phariſee marvelled at Chriſt that he had not firſt waſhed</hi> (in Greek, been Baptized). Did the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee wonder, that Chriſt did not firſt dip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all over? It's plain, he meant no more than waſhing his hands. And this waſhing uſed by the Phariſees, is deſcribed (ſaith Dr. <hi>Worth</hi>) in the Jewiſh antiquities, to have been, by holding up their hands, and pouring water on them (as often as we do). The like they did on their beds, whereon they lay at their Meat, which is called a Baptizing them. And if I might give my thoughts without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, I conceive the reaſon why <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is not uſed in thoſe, and ſuch other places, was becauſe the Phariſees, did not account it a meer civil thing, but a Religious thing; and that <hi>Baptizo</hi>] is there uſed, not to ſhew, that it was a waſhing by Dipping, but that it was accounted by them a piece of Holineſs, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purifications among the Jews were, that were appointed by God and ſet forth by that word, Such was their Superſtition.</p>
               <p>And as for the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which you ſay is uſed for Dipping or Baptizing in the Old-Teſtament; and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for waſhing perſons or things, by ſwilling, rinſing or rubbing; you ſhall find it uſed, for the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hands as clean as may be; which your ſelf ſay, was by dipping of them under
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42315:102"/>water. See both the words uſed, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.30, 31. And as for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which you ſay doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſignifie to dip (wholly under) or elſe it will make nothing for you) I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſome of the Scriptures to your ſecond thoughts, which you have quoted; and ſome others, where the ſame word is uſed, which it ſeems, you could not find. In Gen. 37.31. <hi>They killed a kid, &amp; dipped the Coat in the Blood.</hi> Is it probable, that the Coat was ſo little, or the blood of a ſmall kid ſo much, as that they could dip the whole Coat under the Blood? let reaſonable Men judge. Again, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.6. <hi>He ſhall take the Living-Bird, and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar-wood, and the skarlet and the Hyſop, and dip them in the Blood of the Bird, that was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> Is it credible that the Bird, that was killed, did yield ſo much Blood, that all thoſe things could be dipped under it, and covered with it? certainly, you muſt at leaſt run to a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> here; or elſe you will make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it. And if you do ſo, and ſay, a part of each of them only was dipped, why will you not, at leaſt, allow the ſame in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? ſee the like, in <hi>v.</hi> 51. Alſo <hi>Ruth.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Dip thy Morſel in the Vinegar.</hi> So ſhe might do, though ſhe did not plunge it over, and over; mannerly people uſe not to do ſo; nor is there ſo much uſually brought in a diſh at once; for one ſo to do.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42315:102"/>
               <p> Hence alſo I collect, that according to the ſignification of that word in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a thing may be ſaid to be dipped, that is wetted or ſtrained with ſome other liquid thing; or, that hath only ſome part dipped though the whole be not plunged under it.</p>
               <p>Beſides the uſe of the words in Scripture both Hebrew and Greek, I mind a Greek verſe of the Athenian Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, cited by Mr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It's alſo in <hi>Paſor</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>p.</hi> 133. of his Book, which I wonder you did not confute (for I perceive you have read him) wherein he gives you the ſignification of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in oppoſition to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; That is, <hi>Baptize or waſh him, as a bottle in water; but do not drown him,</hi> or utterly plunge him. It would have brought this debate into a leſs compaſs, if you had anſwered what he, and other able men have elaborately penned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt dipping in Baptiſm; which I cannot perceive you have done; nor to other things in this controverſie already extant: your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments moſt of them being already anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, over and over.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You would prove dipping to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mode of Baptizing, from the practice we find in Scripture; and then you Inſtance in many Examples; which I find abundantly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:42315:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>replied unto already; by ſundry Learned and Holy Men; and had you confuted their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Reaſons, you had done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſay you, being Baptized, he went ſtraight way out of the water, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. Therefore he was dipped. I Anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, from the water; and it's ſaid, he went up, becauſe there was an aſcent up to the Bank; as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſee in Rivers. He went up from the water; therefore he was dipped; is ſuch a Conſequence, as you will not allow us to make concerning Infants-Baptiſm; yea though we bring thoſe that are far more clear and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was Baptized naked, or in his Clothes: not naked doubtleſs; He that was a pattern of Holineſs, would not have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that before all the people, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.21. Not in his Clothes; for immediately the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit drove him into the Wilderneſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. not in that wet condition doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: Therefore he was not dipped.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>John</hi> Baptized in <hi>Aenon</hi> near <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim,</hi> becauſe there was much water there: Therefore he uſed dipping.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word is many waters; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which might not ſo much ſignifie the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:42315:103"/>depth of the water; as—1.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vde ntur ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riplures rivs, non autem unu m flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men magnum.</hi> Piſcat.</note> That there were many ſtreams of water there— 2. That the water was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry broad there. <hi>Aenon</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a little Fountain, from the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. (ſo <hi>Paſor.</hi>) And Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, ſaith Dr. <hi>Worth,</hi> in their deſcription of <hi>Canaan</hi> deſcribe it thus. Nigh unto <hi>Salim</hi> (ſince that, called <hi>Scythopolis) Jordan</hi> branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth into another ſmall River; which at firſt, ſpreading it ſelf, on that plain in breadth is very ſhallow.—And where it is thus ſpread, and thereby broad, is (the Town) <hi>Aenon</hi> ſcituated, where <hi>John</hi> Baptized; and there (ſaith he) the River is ſo ſhallow, that it is not poſſible to dip, or douſe over head and ears, a little Child therein. See his Book called Scripture-evidence for Baptizing-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <hi>pag.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>And then, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. He gives you his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why <hi>John</hi> Baptized at <hi>Aenon</hi> becauſe of thoſe many waters there; which may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be this, (ſaith he). <hi>John</hi> having Baptized at <hi>Bethabara, John</hi> 1.28. (which was the moſt frequent paſſage over <hi>Jordan, Judg.</hi> 7.24.) in regard of the great concourſe uſually there, that his Doctrine and Baptiſm might be promulgated; and having Initiated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſciples; and other multitudes ſtill daily
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:42315:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>flocking to him, he choſe rather to perform this duty at <hi>Aenon,</hi> than any longer at <hi>Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara;</hi> becauſe at <hi>Aenon</hi> (the water ſpreading in a larger Plain) the Multitude of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, might better hear his Sermons, and ſee his adminiſtration of Baptiſm, than if performed under the ſhading-banks of <hi>Jordan.</hi> This Reaſon ſeems clear, but the other, from the depth of the water, doth not; for, it ſeems the water was deeper at <hi>Bethabara</hi> where he Baptized before. It's therefore a very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ground, to bottom dipping upon, from a ſuppoſition of the depth of the waters there.</p>
               <p>A third Scripture you mention, is <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36, 38, 39. <hi>Philip and the Eunuch went both down into the water; and</hi> Philip <hi>Baptized him:</hi> and again, <hi>they both came up</hi> (or aſcended) <hi>out of the water;</hi> therefore dipping was uſed. — I Anſwer;</p>
               <p n="1">1 Their going down unto, or into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and going up out of, or from the water, ſeems to reſpect the way from the Bank to the River; (as before), and not, that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch was dipped, and came up out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which covered him before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If their going down into the water, were an Argument for dipping; then <hi>Philip</hi> muſt be dipped as well as the Eunuch; for both of them went down, and both of them came up out of the water.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:42315:104"/> 3. What great matter was it for them in thoſe hot Countries, and who were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals (and uſually waſht their feet, when they came into a Houſe from their journies) to go into the water; though it were up to their Ancles or Knees? This cannot prove dipping in Baptiſm. Their feet indeed (like the Feet of the Prieſts, that bare the Ark) might be <hi>dipped in the Brim of the water, Joſh.</hi> 3.15. but that's nothing to dipping the whole Body.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To dip this Eunuch naked, had been unſuitable to Chriſtian-modeſty; and to dip him in his Clothes, had been unſuitable to his Travelling-condition; who, it ſeems, made no ſtop, nor ſtay, but went on his way rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. It's moſt probable therefore, that <hi>Philip</hi> Baptized him, by pouring-water on him. What-ever hath been the judgment of Godly-Men, about dipping; our Rule is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; our of which we are with all Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſeek the mind of God, and to ſettle our Conſciences and Practice.</p>
               <p>A fourth Scripture you mention, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. Buried with him in Baptiſm; where (ſay you) the Apoſtle elegantly alludes to the Ceremony of Baptizing, in our Death and Reſurrection with Chriſt. To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42315:105"/> 1. In Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> words; we uſe not to bury Men, by throwing them down with their Faces downward (as when perſons are dived with their Faces under water) but by laying them in, with their Faces upwards; nor do we plunge them into the duſt and Earth, but pour and ſprinkle duſt and broken Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. If therefore, the ſimilitude of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying be ſignified in the manner of Baptizing then pouring on water, or ſprinkling, will better expreſs it than dipping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If dipping under the water, doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our being-buried with Chriſt; and riſing out of the water, doth Sacramentally and Ceremonially ſignifie our riſing with Chriſt; then there muſt be proportionably, ſomething alſo in the outward Ceremony, that muſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our dying to ſin with Chriſt; for a Man ſhould be dead, before he is buried. And the Apoſtle is expreſs in it, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Know ye not, that as many as are Baptized into Chriſt, are Baptized into his Death?</hi> And yet you ſhew no outward part of the Ceremony, that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall endeavour to clear the Text, by giving my thoughts upon it; yet ſtill ready to receive further light from any. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>v.</hi> 1. Labours to prevent the abuſe of that precious Doctrine of <hi>abounding Grace,</hi> treated of Immediately before, and with an Holy
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:42315:105"/>abhorrency rejects that abuſe. As if he ſhould ſay; I have told you, O Believing <hi>Romans!</hi> That ſuch is the Riches of God's Grace in Chriſt, and the reigning Glory of it, that where ſin abounded, there pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace more abounded. Let none of us hence reſolve to commit the more ſin, that Grace may more abound; for we that have Believed in Chriſt for the pardon of our ſins, and for Juſtification by his imputed-Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, are dead to ſin; and therefore ſhould live no longer in it. <hi>Do ye not know, that as many of us, as were Baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were Baptized into his Death.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>We are Buried with him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the Glory of the Father, even ſo, we alſo</hi> (to wit, that are in Chriſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at leaſt, and have been Baptized into him) <hi>ſhould walk in newneſs of Life, v.</hi> 4. This latter he amplifies by a <hi>Simile</hi> to the former; <hi>For, if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his Death; we ſhall be alſo, in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection, v.</hi> 5. from whence it ſeems clear; That their Baptiſm was a Sign and Seal more generally of their Implantation into Chriſt, Externally at leaſt, and thereupon more particularly, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of their Communion with Chriſt in his death, for the mortification of ſin in the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:42315:106"/>beginnings of it; and in his Burial, for the further mortification of ſin, in the progreſs of it; alſo, in his Reſurrection, for quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-power, and ſpiritual Life, not only at firſt, but all along, that they might lead a new and a Holy Life, and abound therein more and more. See <hi>John</hi> 14.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. We ſee then, the ſcope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in urging them with their <hi>being Buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm</hi>] was not at all, to make the Ceremony of Baptiſm to reſemble that of Burial, or of Reſurrection; but to ſignifie and Seal their implantation into Chriſt and ſo their Union with Chriſt; and alſo conſequently their Communion with him, in his Death and Reſurrection, the vertue of both which, they were to labour for, by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, all their days.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſay <hi>p.</hi> 249. That it is a very unuſal thing ſo to deal with unclean hands, to wit, to ſprinkle or pour water upon them; I think it is very uſual. What mean thoſe little Ciſterns in many Houſes, with Cocks in them, to let the water run upon the hands to waſh them? I Believe, I could waſh my hands as clean that way, as you could waſh yours by dipping them into the water; and I ſhould not count her a Slut, that would ſo waſh her hands when they were foul. Our experience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you ſee, tells us, that there is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:42315:106"/>a way to waſh our dirty-hands, by pouring water upon them, as by dipping them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, unleſs you rinſe or rub, as well as dip, you will not eaſily make clean work of it; and if this your ſimilitude hold you muſt not only dip the perſon you Baptize, but you muſt rinſe or rub him too, to ſignifie his cleanſing.</p>
               <p>You take away the cavils of unſeemlineſs from dipping, by ſaying, It is the fruit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>rnal Wiſdom, Unbelief, and ſhunning the the Croſs, and ſo, no other than to reproach the Wiſdom of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Were it apparent from Scripture, that Chriſt had ordained Dipping, and himſelf ſo practiſed it, as you affirm, I hope, through the Grace of Chriſt, many of his people, would not count it undecent, as now they do. And there muſt be clearer light to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that are conſiderate of it, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny you have yet held forth. And I much wonder, that you, who will not admit of Conſequences concerning Infants-Baptiſm (which are far more rational and certain) ſhould content your ſelf with ſuch uncertain ones, as you have brought for dipping. I would only recite, out of Mr. <hi>Cobbet, p.</hi> 212. what he ſaith <q>out of <hi>Nicephorus. lib.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. of the flying of the Women naked, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:42315:107"/>beſet with armed-Men, as they were to be Baptized; and that ſad ſtory of a Prieſt, defiling of a Woman,</q> when to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>Then, as to the hazard of health; you ſay known experience doth amply refute that vain Imagination. You will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, I hope, if the experience of ſome others, be ſet againſt yours. It is more than probable that ſome have preſently upon it, fallen into a Fever, which coſt them their lives. And I could tell you of ſome Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes credible-perſons, who ſaw both the Baptizer and the Baptized in danger of drowning; and had very probably been both drowned, if one had not leapt in from the bank in his Clothes and relieved them both. I would not have mentioned theſe things, had not your words required an anſwer; for it is Truth, and Peace, that I aim at, and not Contention and bitterneſs.</p>

                  <head>To your Chapter V. <hi>pag.</hi> 253. I Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>Having (as I truſt) given ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to what you have ſaid, and in ſome meaſure evidenced, and confirmed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary-truth; thoſe ſeveral miſchiefs, abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and contradictions cannot juſtly be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon our practice. I ſhall mention them
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:42315:107"/>very briefly, having ſpoken to moſt of them amply before. Only, I muſt tell you, that the Errours you charge our Doctrine and Practice with, do not naturally (and <hi>perſe</hi>) follow from them, but they are accidental to them, as far as they are Errours. They are the Errours of Perſons only, not of our Doctrine, nor of our Practice, according to our Doctrine. And therefore you injuriouſly charge them upon our Doctrine &amp; Practice. It is <hi>fallacia ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentis.</hi> As for what is Truth in any of them, we own, and have proved it before; but the moſt of them, you falſly charge upon us. Let thoſe that own what is Erroneous in their Expreſſions, make them good if they can; or rather repent of them. Our Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Infant-Intereſt and Baptiſm, will ſtand without them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Baptizing of the Infants of Inchurched-Parents, is not an altering of the Order of Chriſts Commiſſion, as hath been proved; but it is acting according to his Commiſſion. Diſciples we have proved them to be, and ſo by Chriſt's Commiſſion to be Baptized. Repentance and Faith viſibly-profeſſed, at leaſt, ſhould precede in grown-perſons; not ſo in Infants; but their Baptiſm and being Externally in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is to engage and ſtir them up to ſeek to God for Repentance and Faith. And this Anſwer will undermine all the reſt of your
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42315:108"/>abſurdities, miſchiefs, and contradictions. It's no changing of the ſubjects that Chriſt hath appointed. Nor a fruſtrating of the holy and Spiritual Ends of Baptiſm, but a means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, if it be rightly-improved. Nor doth it invert the Order, by ſprinkling or pouring water upon the face. Nor doth it naturally, and of it ſelf, introduce any Errour or falſe Doctrine. We do not hold, that it is to take away Original Sin. Nor that it doth of it ſelf, work Grace and Regeneration; yet, we dare not limit the Lord, that he ſhould not work it then, or at any other time, when he pleaſeth. And that it was an Apoſtolical Tradition, we own it no otherwiſe than from their writings and practice recorded in the Scripture. If any make it an unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; let them pleaſe themſelves with their own fancy. Nor doth it maintain, that Children have Faith; though it is beyond your reach to ſay, this, or that Child hath no Faith, <hi>ſecret things belong to God.</hi> But that they are Diſciples of Chriſt, and in Chriſt's School, we have proved, though they have not yet learnt one Letter. That all the Infants of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched-Believers are Externally in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and federally-Holy; I have proved, and you cannot prove it to be an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or falſe Doctrine. Nor doth it defile and pollute the Church; either by bringing
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:42315:108"/>falſe matter therein, who are no Saints by cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling; neither capable to perform Duties, nor enjoy priviledges. Thoſe words, Saints by calling (if you mean, ſuch as have Actually anſwered the call of Chriſt in his word, at leaſt in the judgment of Charity) reſpect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Adult-perſons, who are immediate-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and not Children, who are Mediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by means of their Inchurched-Parents, as middle perſons appointed of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them into that Eſtate, and Relation. This diſtinction will free the Church from pollution; of which more hath been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We do not hold, that a Church is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, or made up, only of Infants; but of grown perſons, who alone are able to perform Duties. But Infants are capable of enjoying Priviledges. Is it not a Priviledge for God to be their God Externally in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? To be under a promiſe of God's Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the heart; and to provide them outward means for that End. Some of your perſwaſion, have held that they have great priviledges. They are then true matter of the Church as viſible, in their kind, and do not pollute and defile it. By your Argument, the Children of the Jews muſt be falſe matter; for they were no Saints by calling, nor could they perform duties; yet they were mediate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, and a part of that holy-people;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:42315:109"/>as hath been ſhewed.—Nor doth it lay a Foundation of Ignorance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs; but the Contrary; as I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly proved. Nor is it a confounding World and Church together; nor bringing the World into the Church, and turning the Church into the World. You will ſee the contrary, if you impartially-weigh what I have ſaid before. This reaſoning of yours, is as much againſt Children of the Jews here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, as againſt ours now. Was the World and the Church confounded in the Church in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Family and afterwards? Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were of the Church then. You may eaſily ſee a way to ſolve this doubt, if you conſider, that their Infant-Memberſhip gives them not a Title to the Memberſhip and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Adult-Members; but they muſt attain to thoſe, by a credible profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith, and laying hold of the Covenant themſelves.—Nor do we hereby introduce and eſtabliſh, any, (much leſs many) humane Traditions and Inventions of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, nor take God's name in vain; but San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his name, in giving to our Children, what his Gracious Majeſty hath bequeathed to them. Nor is it of it ſelf a bone of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among them that own it, or oppoſe it; but by accident only, to wit, through their ignorance or perverſneſs. Nor is it of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:42315:109"/>it ſelf any juſt occaſion of hatred, wrath and perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor doth it confirm the whole Antichriſtian Intereſt, as you ſay, you have made good in your Preface. Nor doth it maintain, that perſons may have Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Grace (if you mean ſpiritual and ſanctifying Grace) before calling; but only External-Covenant-Grace. Nor, that Adult perſons may be viſible-Church-Members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, before Converſion credibly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Nor that perſons may Repent, Believe and be Saved by the Faith of another; yet, that the Children of Inchurched Believers may be Baptized, we do hold. Nor that thoſe Types and ſhadows that are in Chriſt fulfilled and aboliſhed, are at all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable now to be practiſed; though we hold the Doctrine of them, of profitable uſe ſtill. But we cannot comply with you, that the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Birth-priviledge (as you call it) was a Type or Shadow of the Regenerate ſeed, now in Goſpel-days; and ſo muſt ceaſe; which I have ſpoken to before. Nor doth it revive Judaiſm, and out Chriſtianity, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that Gracious Covenant made with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Church-Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. It is that Ancient Covenant of Grace diſpenſed in a Church-way to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is ſolemnly laid hold of to enter Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans &amp; their Seed, into the Viſible-Church, &amp; no
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:42315:110"/>new humane Invention inſtead thereof. Is it not by this Covenant laid hold of and profeſſed, that your Churches conſiſt? See <hi>Iſa</hi> 56.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 a prophecy of Goſpel-times. If not, they cannot be ſaid, to be the Church-Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> Nor doth this tend at all to Exclude Believers Baptiſm, that have not been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized before; but to eſtabliſh it. And there is good reaſon (as hath been ſhewed) to deny thoſe that were only Mediate Members and Baptized in Infancy, the right of the Church-Memberſhip of Immediate Members, and the Priviledges peculiar to them; until by their own credible profeſſion, and laying hold of the Covenant themſelves, they become Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Members, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4.6, 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3, 4, 5. As for thoſe, that hold the Children of Inchurched-Parents to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> and kind with them, and hold not the diſtinction of Mediate and Immediate Members; I think your Aſſertion, will reflect upon their Principle and Practice; for I could never yet ſee, how they could free themſelves rationally, from the plea, of ſuch Children, when grown up, (owned ſtill by them as Members of the ſame kind with their Parents) and having no groſs-Crimes to lay againſt them; and yet deny them the Priviledges of Adult-Members. I muſt leave it to them, to make it out; for I
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42315:110"/>ſhall not undertake it. See Mr. <hi>Davenport's</hi> ſecond Eſſay, in Anſwer to the Synod at <hi>Boſton.</hi> I have often thought that this, and ſome other like things, have been an occaſion of ſtumbling to ſome of your perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; who have not been able to ſee how ſuch ſhould be rationally ſatisfied; and the Church kept free from pollution, and therefore they have oppoſed the Memberſhip and Baptiſm of Children.</p>
                  <p>As to your firſt contradiction, I muſt crave pardon, if I tell you, it wants Charity and Candour. You may eaſily ſee, that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> ſpeaks of Adult-perſons only, though perhaps he hath not expreſt it. And indeed Sir, I find, you have been often guilty of that fault in your Book. I ſuppoſe you would count it a piece of diſ-ingenuity, and want of Charity, if one ſhould conſtrue ſome ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of yours, in <q>that manner. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſay you, All whoſe poſterity were to be marked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that is, with Circumciſion, <hi>p.</hi> 228. and <hi>p.</hi> 230. You ſay, There were all the Families and Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and all proſelyted ſtrangers) with their Children, without diſtinction of good or bad, to be Circumciſed.] Now, if one ſhould charge this upon you,</q> that you meant the Woman and Female-Children ſhould be
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42315:111"/>Circumciſed (for, they were part of the Tribes and Families of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) or that all the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> in their Generations, were to be marked with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; which alſo you have denied] I doubt you would not think your ſelf well dealt withal. Yet, thus you have done, with many others; and I hope you will ſee it, and Repent of it. Baptiſm is a Symbol of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Regeneration, in the judgment of Charity to Adult-Perſons; but of future Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Infants. <hi>The Lord thy God will Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe the heart of thy Seed, Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>
                  <p>To your Second <hi>pag.</hi> 257. Baptiſm truly figures Implantation into Chriſt; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Communion with him in the vertue of his Death, Burial and Reſurrection; but the outward manner and Ceremony doth not particularly repreſent all thoſe things; as I have before proved.—To your third, is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the firſt. To your fourth I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the ſimilitude of Marriage, of which Baptiſm may be a Declaration, is not to be extended to every thing that belongs to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<note place="margin">Similitudo non currit quatuor.</note> but to be applied on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that particular, that it is brought to illuſtrate. You know I ſuppoſe that ſimilitudes do not run upon all four. Chriſt is compared to a Thief; if any ſhould
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42315:111"/>extend that ſimilitude beyond what Chriſt in tended it, he would make Thieviſh-work of it. The ſcope of that place <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. is not to ſhew how the ſoul was married to Chriſt, and what conſent was required; but to ſet forth the great love of Chriſt to his Church in Juſtifying, Sanctifying and Saving them; from whence he draws an Argument, to preſs Husbands to love their Wives; as is plain there. And he being the head of the Church as Viſible, as well as Inviſible; his Love to her is great in affording means to thoſe Spiritual and Saving Ends; And ſo Infants will come under it; but not Stones and Bells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, I pray further conſider, whether according to your arguing, any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant can be Spiritually and Savingly Married to Chriſt? and ſo be ſaved? He is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of giving conſent, not to reſtipulate; no more than Stones, or Bells, or Church-Walls: I Believe God ſaves ſome Infants, but not Bells and Stones.—To the fifth, hath been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before.—To your ſixth, I Anſwer; That Godly Men do not judg the Baptiſm a Nullity, diſpenſed by the Papiſts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it were clogged with divers humane Inventions; and therefore they require not a Renouncing their Baptiſm as Null; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for what hath been amiſs therein. To your ſeventh, They Baptize the Children
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42315:112"/>of Inchurched-Believers, becauſe they are Externally and Eccleſiaſtically in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace; and not becauſe they have true ſanctifying Grace in them; from which alone, they hold that a man cannot fall; from the other, he may fall and be rejected; and yet their Doctrine of not falling from Grace, ſtand firm. This Argument I muſt again return upon you; for you Baptize a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Believer, becauſe you count him Savingly in the Covenant of Grace, but afterwards he appears not to be ſo, and you reject him. It is you therefore that hold a falling from Grace and not we. For we Baptize, becauſe they are Externally in the Covenant, and that we can know; but you Baptize, becauſe they are Spiritually and Savingly in the Covenant elſe you would not Baptize them; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you come to ſee they are not ſo. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Baptize upon uncertainties, and your Tenet holds falling from Grace.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the Baptizing of Inchurched-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, make the Traditions of Men, of equal Authority with the Law of God. In this we are accounted down-right Phariſees. Nor doth it overthrow the Covenant, deriving a Title by Natural-Generation; but on the Contrary, it is according to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7, 9. <hi>Thee and thy Seed after Thee; in their Generations;</hi> that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42315:112"/>is, <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Church-Seed, as well as his Spiritual-Seed, now in theſe Goſpel-days; <hi>The bleſſing of</hi> Abraham <hi>being come upon us Gentiles, Gal.</hi> 3.14. And that Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt of neceſſity, be a Covenant-Bleſſing. — Nor doth it make Religion to lie in the deed done. This is for Formaliſts and Papiſts, who reſt in <hi>opere operato;</hi> and doth not of it ſelf, follow from Paedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. Did Circumciſion of Infants of old, of its own Nature, and <hi>per ſe,</hi> make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to lie in the deed done? It is the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin of formal Parents, and Children when grown, to abuſe their Baptiſm, and take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion thence, to place their Religion in the deed done. Suppoſe ſome that are Baptized in your way, take occaſion thence, to place their Religion in the deed done (as ſome have Reaſon to ſuſpect, too many do) you will not I preſume, lay the blame upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf, but upon them for abuſing it. You will ſay, It is accidental to the Ordinance and would no doubt, blame them, that would deſtroy the Baptizing of profeſſing-Believers, upon that Ground. And why then, ſhould the Baptizing of Infants, be cried down, upon the ſame Ground?</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe you have ſeen, that people ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly-Godly, do not (through Grace) reſt in the deed done, what-ever Hypocrites may do;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42315:113"/>but do ply the Throne of Grace with Prayers and Tears, that God would Baptize their Children with the Holy-Ghoſt; and are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to train them up, in the Nurture and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord. And do not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren themſelves, to whom God begins to bleſs inſtructions, ſeek him for the Grace of the Covenant, and of the Seal of it? I have known it, I bleſs the Lord. And how then muſt it needs be a placing Religion in the deed done?</p>
                  <p>Again, it doth not revive Judaiſm, and Ceremonial Typical-Holineſs, of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed, (which you have ſo much ſpoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) which did end at Chriſt's coming. No, but it keeps alive, that Ancient-Covenant-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Inchurched Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> promiſed to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.—and ſuch Judaiſm, we ſhall not be aſhamed to own. It's ſaid <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They that are of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> And the great Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>that God would be his God, and the God of his Seed;</hi> to wit; not only of his Spiritual Seed Savingly, but of his Church-Seed Eccleſiaſtically. Thoſe then that are of Faith, are thus bleſſed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Abraham; God is the God of them and of their Seed,</hi> in both ſenſes reſpectively, as he was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed then. Again, in <hi>v.</hi> 16. when he ſaith, <hi>To Abraham and his Seed were
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42315:113"/>the Promiſes made;</hi> 
                     <q>by Seed there is meant Chriſt; as conſidered, not perſonally, but Myſtically, Chriſt with his Body the Church;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Beza</hi> in <hi>Loc.</hi>
                        </note> The name Chriſt being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of that whole collected-Body, whoſe head and Life,</q> Chriſt is; and the Members of it are the faithful, gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <q>partly of the Jews, and partly of the Gentiles.</q> And Chriſt being the bond of the Members of that Body; it's no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <q>that he calls it Chriſt himſelf,</q> by which name he denoteth, not only the Head, but alſo the Members conjoined with the Head. Now, Chriſt being the Head, not only of his Church conſidered as Inviſible, but alſo as Viſible, in which there be ſome only Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and that are not true Believers indeed; Hence Hypocrites, and alſo the Children of Inchurched-Parents, are <hi>Abraham's</hi> Church-Seed, to whom there are Promiſes made. So that here is not one word to prove, that the Natural-Seed of Inchurched-Believers (which indeed are the Church-Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) were excluded at Chriſt's coming or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; or that the Holineſs of the Natural-Church-Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was Typical; or that Paedo-Baptiſm revives Judaiſm.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that Chriſt is there taken for the Church of Jews and Gentiles, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42315:114"/>only as Inviſible; conſider then, where you will rank your Inchurched-Hypocrite, who made a new External performance of the conſent? and was Married to Chriſt in his Viſible-Church, for baſe Ends. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you held his Marriage good, or elſe you would not have Baptized him. Yet, he failed both in the Manner; for he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the conſent of his Will, to Marry Chriſt, but did lie: and in the End alſo; for he had no Sanctifying and ſaving Grace, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor in that Ordinance of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>Acts</hi> 10.28. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15. They indeed ſhew that the Ceremonial Law was now aboliſhed, and way made for the Goſpel, and Salvation thereby to come among the Gentiles; which plainly proves an enlargement of the Grace of God, and not a ſtraitning; and therefore, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Seed of Inchurched-Parents, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by Chriſts coming.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the Baptiſm of Infants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſeparation, keep us upon the Old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or make us ſymbolize with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Let the experience we have, of reformed Congregational Churches that keep cloſe to their Rule, ſpeak for us; whether Infant-Baptiſm deſtroys ſuch a ſeparation, as the Goſpel requires. Children are Mediate Members of a diſtinct kind and <hi>ſpecies,</hi> from
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42315:114"/>their Inchurched-Parents. And this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip (though it intitle them to Baptiſm, which is the Seal of their ingrafting into the Viſible Body and Church of Chriſt, yet it) cannot entitle them to thoſe Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Priviledges, which are peculiar to Adult and Immediat Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. If therefore, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them, they muſt profeſs their Faith and Repentance to the Church; and come and Marry the Church, by their Solemn en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring perſonally into Covenant with her, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.4, 6, 7. and engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the ſtrongeſt bonds, to the Lord and his Church. See this plainly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3, 4, 5. <hi>One ſhall ſay I am the Lords, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall readily confeſs, that Infant-Baptiſm of Inchurched-Parents, keeps us upon the old bottom of that Ancient Covenant of Grace, made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Church-Seed, as well as his ſpiritual Seed; and that is no diſhonour nor damage to us. But it keeps us not upon the old Romiſh Antichriſtian bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; nor doth it make us ſymbolize with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is now Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; but with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it was once Apoſtolique, planted and watered by the Apoſtles. It's known, that Baptizing of Infants, was in Uſe long before the Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> was in being. And if ſhe yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42315:115"/>an Ordinance of God, and we ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with her in that, as far as it is God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, the Lord will not blame us for it, though Men do. 'Hear what Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> ſaith; Book of Martyrs <hi>Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 607. <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaith he, if you look upon the Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Synagogue only, which hath corrupted God's word by falſe interpretations, and perverted the true Uſe of Chriſt's Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you might ſeem to have good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt of your opinion, againſt the Baptiſm of Infants. But for as much as it is of more Antiquity, and hath its beginning from God's word, and from the uſe of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, it muſt not, in reſpect of the abuſe in the Popiſh Church, be neglected, or thought not expedient to be uſed in Chriſt's Church.</q> If this Argument be valid, why do you uſe Baptiſm at all? and Dipping? Which thing the Papiſts uſe.</p>
                  <p>I hope it now appears, that the miſchiefs, abſurdities and contradictions, that you have loaded Paedo-Baptiſm and Paedo-Baptiſts with, are falſe, miſchievous and abſurd, and contradictory to the Truth, and therefore not to be defended and charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by you, but to be repented of.</p>

                  <head>To your Chapter VI. <hi>Pag.</hi> 261.</head>
                  <p>Wherein you ſay, The Nullity and utter Inſignificancy of Infants-Baptiſm, is made appear; in that it wants the Eſſentials, to wit, Matter and Form. And coming to ſhew, that it hath not a right matter, in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you bring in the Subject and ſay, The right Subject of Baptiſm is wanting.</p>
                  <p>Here I muſt crave leave to tell you, that you miſs it, in your Logick. For, Matter] is one of the two Eſſential Cauſes, that gives being to the effect; but the Subject is not ſo, but in order of Nature at leaſt, it follows the Effect. It is <hi>Argumentum modo quodam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneum,</hi> and not <hi>Abſolute conſentaneum,</hi> as Cauſe and effect are. Here then, is a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <hi>a genere ad Genus.</hi> The matter of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is Water; and the External form of it, is the due application of it unto the perſon, <hi>in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which I have ſhewed, to be a pouring of water upon the face, and not a dipping of the whole perſon, under water, &amp; raiſing him up again, to figure our Burial &amp; Reſurrection with Chriſt; as you affirm it doth, in the outward Ceremony of it. I have ſpoken largely to that before; evidencing it to to be a Sign and Seal of our Implantation
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:42315:116"/>into Chriſt Externally at leaſt; and ſo, of our Union, and conſequently Communion with him in his Death, Burial and Reſurrection; but not that the outward form of Baptiſm, doth expreſly and particularly repreſent thoſe things unto us; which is the thing you would have, to introduce Dipping.</p>
                  <p>Here then, we ſee, are the Eſſentials of Baptiſm; to wit, Matter and Form; the Subject is no part of the Eſſence of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: that belongs to the third Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But Baptiſm it ſelf, to the ſecond. The one is a piece of Inſtituted-Worſhip: the other, the Subject to whom it is applied; and the Application as to Infants of Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Parents, determined long before, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reverſed, but confirmed, now in Goſpel-times; which cannot be ſaid of Bells and Churches, and ſuch like things as Papiſts wickedly-Baptize. An Infant of Inchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-Parents is not of the Eſſence of Baptiſm it ſelf; as neither was heretofore, an Infant of the Eſſence of Circumciſion. Baptiſm is one thing, and the Infant is another. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is but one ſort of the Subject of Baptiſm, and is not of the Eſſence of the Ordinance; as neither is a profeſſing-Believer, but he is one ſort of the Subject Recipient, to whom the Ordinance is diſpenſed. The Infant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was determined in the Covenant long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:42315:116"/>and was never caſt out, and therefore ſhould ſtill enjoy that Priviledge; it being the ſame Gracious Covenant for the ſubſtance, that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Church in his Family, that is come upon us Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and not another; which being continued, and extended to In-Churched-Parents and their Children, in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-days, there needed not an Expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for their Infants, that they ſhould be Baptized. And this kind of Arguing, is not from one Covenant to another, (as ſome would have it) but from one and the ſame Covenant, and the Initiatory Seal of it, to another Initiatory Seal of it, which, by God's appointment, is come into the place of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer long ſince aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>As for what you ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 263. There is no Covenant, where there is no conſent; and therefore there can be no Covenant with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; for they cannot give conſent.] It is very untrue. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is contrary to Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. How did the Infants of the Jews conſent? And yet God made his Covenant with them; for they are expreſly mentioned, and were ſome of that Body of People, that entred into a Covenant with God that day; <hi>Ye ſtand this day all of you before the Lord your God; Your Captains — with all the Men of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:42315:117"/>Iſrael, your little ones</hi>] <hi>that thou</hi> (to wit, Collective <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of which the little ones were a part) <hi>ſhouldst enter into a Covenant, with the Lord thy God, and into his Oath, which he maketh with thee this day.</hi> Here we have God making his Covenant not only with them but with their little ones expreſly; who were not capable of giving their conſent; but their Parents in whoſe Power they were, did reſtipulate for them. How contrary is your aſſertion unto this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is alſo contrary to reaſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience. Do not Fathers often Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for their Children, in Leaſes, and Deeds of Land and alſo bind them to ſeveral Cnodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and others Covenant to them, and their Children? Do they not often ſettle an Eſtate upon a Child, that knows nothing of it, and engage their Child to ſuch and ſuch Tearms, though he be not capable of giving his conſent? yea ſometimes a Child in the womb? If therefore, God, that gave me my Child, and alſo a Fatherly-power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, condeſcend to enter into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace with me, and with my Child, Externally at leaſt, promiſing to be my God and the God of my Child; Have I not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enter my ſelf, and my Child into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him though my Child know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, nor is at preſent capable of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42315:117"/>his conſent? And ſhould not I and my Child alſo, when he comes to Age, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the rich Grace of God therein? Surely, there's all reaſon for it. And if the Lord be alſo pleaſed to Seal this Covenant to me and to my Child, though at preſent he is not capable of giving his conſent; Is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a nullity, a meer nothing? Is he not bound to make uſe of it, when he is grown up, and to ſeek unto this Covenant-God for Regenerating Grace?</p>
                  <p>What other Men of larger Principles hold, will not concern thoſe, that conſent not with them. It is therefore a little unbrotherlike, to beat us with their Cudgels.</p>
                  <p>Whom you account a right Miniſter, I know not; but I have often thought, that every Brother, whom thoſe of your perſwaſion call forth to diſpenſe that Ordinance, is not a right Miniſter; and therefore to return the words of <hi>Chamier</hi> upon you in the ſence he meant them; It is not a Sacrament, but a raſh mockery, or deceiving, by no means to be endured in the Church, and ſo that ſpeech will fall with more equity upon you, than upon us about the Baptizing of Infants. Yet ſome Godly, and judicious, do judge a little more charitably; that when it is done in the way of an Ordinance, it is not a meer Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, though it hath been defective in ſome
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:42315:118"/>things Circumſtantial: <hi>fieri non debuit, factum valet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, I ſuppoſe I have Anſwered to the main of your Arguments, though I have not traced you in all places in the Order, that they lie in your Book. Alſo ſome of your humane Teſtimonies I have examined, and find them faulty. As to the reſt, not having the Authors by me, nor time to examine them, I ſhall leave that task to another hand, that hath diligently Examined and ſcanned them, and (as he told me) finds them not a little abuſed, from whom, I ſuppoſe, you you will ſhortly hear. If thoſe debates be bleſſed, to diſcover the truth to your ſelf, or any other, and add any thing to the making up of the breach, <hi>that the Lord may be one, and his Name one amongſt us,</hi> in theſe points, wherein we yet differ; I ſhall have what I aimed at, and the God of Truth and Peace ſhall have all the Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>HAving had an opportunity, to make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſpection into Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; I find, that he hath Anſwered, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Teſtimonies you produce, long ſince produced by Mr. <hi>Tombes;</hi> whoſe large Piece, it ſeems to me, you have epitomized? But take not the leaſt notice (that I can perceive) of the overthrow the Doctor hath given, to thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed-humane Authorities; but bring them in as new things of your own, as if nothing had ever been replied to them. You needed not have ſpent ſo much Paper, had you but read what hath been replied by him and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to your Arguments, which you paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ſilence, as if nothing had been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. My prayer to God is and ſhall be, that God would deliver his people, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluded by dark and covert dealing, which tends to the obſcuring of the Truth, and to a ſpecious promoting of errour. It is matter of grief, to ſee many honeſt and ſimple-hearted Chriſtians, ſuck up your miſtakes, as infallible undoubted, and unanſwerable Truths. The God of Truth make the Truth to appear with ſuch evidence, as that they that are miſled, may embrace and receive it in the love of it; and may be reduced into the way of Truth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed therein.</p>
